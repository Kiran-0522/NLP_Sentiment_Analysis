I have nothing to complain.Last but not the least, the delivery experience was also superb... delivered within 2 days !!! And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to him.Overall a 5 star experience...

Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn\\'t support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money. This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It\\'s sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it\\'s quality. Please never ever buy this product. मोबाइल का कैमरा बिल्कुल भी सही नही है 48 PM बताया और क्लियरिटी 5 मेगा पिक्सल का भी नही है ।मोबाइल भी पुराना सा दिखता है ।इसको नही खरीदे The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don’t buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits. Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good. No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it\\'s a big comedy Don\\'t received  handset ejection  pin  and manual. very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it\\'s very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation. Hitting issue Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it\\'s having high end config. It doesn\\'t look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don\\'t waste money on this product. Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price. PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company. Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don\\'t buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI. Dislike Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0#m12,#m12unboxing,#samsungm12 ,#unboxing ,#Samsung, #Galaxy, #M12,#SamsungGalaxyM12M12 unboxing videoNot so impressive Mobile from Samsung, currently direct compete with LGK42, Moto G30/G10To All people who want to purchase mobile DO NOT go on Mobile Marketing and Actors endorsing Mobile.:Remember 5G is coming hence you are getting so much discount on all 4G mobile. Mobile manufacturers are clearing stocks, Need to inform 5G mobile support 4G band but all 4G mobile will not support 5G.Take example, if you purchase 20,0000 mobile today, after 20 months you may need to change to 5G mobile hence it will cost you 1000 per month (costing matters) and you will not get High exchange value (not even 50% cost), Currently 5G yet to come in India, may be yearend or come will be high cost.Points to Remember while purchasing Mobile:1) Mobile band support, Dual Wi-fi Support is better.2) Graphics PPI matter hence check PPI value of mobile. It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best. Mostly camera quality depends on Focal Value not on pixel4) Android upgrade support. This is important as your mobile will useless within 2 years, remember you don’t want any mobile who cannot upgrade to Android 11.5) Item Weight and height of mobile. Lower is better, it really matter as you will get pain while holding mobile for long time, specially  old people.6) Mobile resolution, Higher is better7) screen refresh rate, Higher is better8) Clean Android installation. This is also important as manufacturers cannot force you to install or retain any app.M12 /Pro6000 battery (not fully tested yet)Android 11, v11.0 operating system, One UI 3.1with 8nm Power Efficient Exynos850 (Octa Core 2.0GHz)90Hz screen refresh rateSamsung Brand (Non-Chinese)Galaxy Store supportDolby Atmos support.

The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can\\'t remove.You\\'re better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can\\'t return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don\\'t list this as a software issue.I\\'ll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that\\'s easier said than done. Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes. Horrible product A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby\\'s impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package. Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this. Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review This is Samsung\\'s worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn\\'t even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information. Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp It\\'s a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they\\'re wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything. I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon... Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we\\'re end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue. I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -• Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it• Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day• Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light• Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings• 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth• The phone doesn\\'t lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -• Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics• The weight of phone is heavy• The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones• The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels• The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range• It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it\\'s camera quality and battery backup √ The phone is good looking, but it doesn\\'t support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that\\'s what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad\\'s 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called \"true\" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆ Heating issueCamera dam 👎 so badSensors issuesUsb isuueDisplay so bad its look like old phone not today\\'s  generation  displayAmazone need to improve software  for check device  and all i think its not goodHeating isueee in phone phone take to much time for chargingSome time rear camera not work properly  for scan qr code and barcodeOverall phone like to throw in dustbin 🗑I don\\'t  expect  product like this from samsung its to bad  experience  from samsung and amazone also im so sad for this review  but i have to do for everyone 😔 so pls don\\'t  buy this product They have conveniently skipped mentioning it is not an amoled display while mentioning 90 Hz refresh rate. Touch response is faulty on these phones and SAR value is high despite having exynos processor, which also they have conveniently skipped mentioning. This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn\\'t feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won\\'t notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn\\'t seem as good.Above average phone for the price.... I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn\\'t have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn\\'t translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost. I recieved the phone today and observed that it is lagging a lot unlike like other Samsung phones. Considering it has 6gb ram it should not be hanging at all.Camera quality is terrible.Lots of heating issuesDoes not connect to 5ghz wifiOnly replacement option available for the product and not refund. So choose the product wisely only after reviewing the feedbacks.Bad network quality. Does not catch mobile network. Don\\'t know if I could get more disappointed by a purchase!!The phone did look okayish in the spec sheet. But it is a very  stupid buy.The first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phone.It is too heavy(220g) and too thick (about 1cm) to carry. The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display. Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out. Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews. I wrote my experience with so many negative points and it rejected. Still I am writing the pros & cons again.PROS:▪︎UI 3.0 is amazing. I like it a lot. It is better than Redmi, Moto, Nokia UI. (Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn\\'t support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you\\'ll have a hard time with its weight. It\\'s like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...upgrade bro.▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed. The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon. Amazon bro...you too planned everything so well. Good job. Good phone in decent budget .Display could\\'ve been better , 90hz is not true to my usage . Since i use op7T it\\'s clearly evident this display lacks the precision which it is said it has .Samsung India : they call me daily to inquire whether i have posted a review and what star rating should i give to the phone . This has become a headache .Dear samsung team , please do not force customer to write reviews and try to reduce the bloatware and unwanted app installations . I am starting to think MIUI was better than this .Display : not that they said / averageCamera : average / specs doesn\\'t meetPerformance : ok for normal useBattery : good .Call quality : goodUI : Poor ,  I will not recommend samsung , this is not the one UI it was when i purchased M30S . Now this is full of bloatware and unwanted apps are getting installed by samsung store . I am puzzled on how to stop this.Overall : Very average phone . Better go for redmi note 10 or any other better phone in this price segment .Not a value for money dela Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven\\'t tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I\\'m a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price. Being die hard fan of Samsung it is very difficult to write this review.Camera quality:why say 48MP  when it doesn\\'t even look like 13MP my Mom\\'s Samsung  M10s  camera quality and screen quality are far better than this phone. Regret for buying this phone for such high price booked on first day of launch as it came from Samsung brand. Generallyi go by reviews  but first time ordered on  launch day becoz of the reliability.I regret for the decision i made. Do not recommend the phone for anyone. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I don\\'t know why Amazon is compromising on its quality to deliver  product\\'s,  its evident nowadays, Recently I have got Samsung M12 product on 7 April 2021 the exchange date is 14 April 2021 ,Now after 7 days this phone display is gone , there is a blur continously in the screen, Plz do not buy this mobile.. I am facing poor network issue. In my home others are using without any interruption.. Tried many things.. Asked colleagues, neighbors, mobile store person, google and tried all the ways.. But internet is very slow.. The same sim is working fine in other devise in same location. Even internet is ON it is showing you are offline when i try something. Also took nore than 45 mins to download 72 mb size app. Atlast i cancelled and came out due to intolerance. I am placing return order, will see what is gonna happen. Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I had received this phone on 09th May 2021. For first two days it worked ok. (OK because this phone is very slow)BUT on third day, 12th May 2021, it was hanged very badly. It was neither getting switched off nor restarted..!!Immediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution. The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician\\'s visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021.Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement.It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital.Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one.Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING.Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise.Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product.There is \"No Return Available\" and only replacement option is given by Amazon.Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support.I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit.Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast \"OK\" level, if not to \"GOOD or BETTER\" standard.Dear Samsung, I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark..!! Decent phone.. people say VGA cam because they didn\\'t notice that the aspect ratio for 48 MP camera.. 48 MP cam option is only for 3:4 aspect ratio..And yea its true that the wifi doesn\\'t support 5G bandwidth..  but over all decent mobile for decent price, Got 6GB version for 11.300 using coupon and credit cardThanking Amazon, IndusInd and Samsung!Posted pics are Shot by me on Samsung M12,Those who dont believe they can ask me for Camera Settings. Don\\'t have slow motion, and to much leg. Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you\\'ll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don\\'t play games so can\\'t review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don\\'t get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update)6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.)Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that\\'s why the phone seems a little bit slow).Update: After update Contact searching speed became very good. The price of the product is OK as per the price bracket. However it was nowhere compared to my old VIVO V5. Made a mistake exchanging the phone.The phone is average... Initially i given 4 star and after few months of usage can see the sound quality degraded and very feeble .. camera outcome is not that much quality as they promised in d specs ..Samsung average phone at average price to meet out china companies competency..My old reviewI have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series. D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR .SAR for this phone model is 1.19W/KG which is within the 1.6 range .Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good 👍Performance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish ..tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series ..Over all okay 👌🙂 ..head set won\\'t be there which they mention in the items that they will provide..Overall decent price 👌 I have Mo2s and this m12....better buy m12 you get better storage ram camera and finger scanner etc....record selling on Amazon...just checking performance...will give review after 1 month....overall good on specs.... Except battery life.. rest other options like camera, display , software are all useless. If Mobile size comes under 6 or 6\\'4 inch then it will be preferable for elder people(above 50 age). Over all it fails in all segments. Micromax in 1 is far better than M12 Samsung is the beat I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback.1. Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage.2. Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube,  Facebook or watsapp and usual games.3. Look and feel is good, easy to use.4. Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity.5. Front camera is not good but back one is good. This maybe great for selfie  lovers.6. Phone doesn\\'t hang when multiple apps are opened.7. Worthy product  for this price based on spec and quality.I have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference.  Overall it\\'s a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery. 1. Mobile is heavy,2. Company has given 48 Megapixel Camera, but camera quality is very poor,3. Mobile is not slim, and it is very thick mobile,4. Screen size is narrower than image5. Never buy, this mobile it is the waste of moneyAs per Amazon Policy they are not ready to return the product, I have wasted my money on this mobile. Genuine feedback after 1 week of usageGood things:Low PriceBad things:1. Battery drains very quickly..my old realme mobile was 3000mah battery but was getting me 1 full day and this phone is 6000mah Battery but drains by evening2. I am using 4GB ram and its very very slow and very lagging..very versatile very horrible3. Finger print scanner everytime i get error message could not detect correct impression try again4. It says 48mp true camera but i could not notice any difference from my old 16mp camera5. No cancelation or refund policy6. NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON IF NO CANCEL/REFUND OPTION IS THEREConclusion:Better to chose any oppo or realme mobile in this budget I bought this phone mainly for my kids online class during this pandemic. We thought to connect the mobile with our TV through HDMI adapter so that our kids can see the class directly on TV. When we tried to connect this mobile with HDMI adapter we came to know that this is not compatible with the adapter since it\\'s USB hub is 2.0 (Don\\'t know why Samsung configures the old USB hub for it\\'s new mobiles). We also checked whether this mobile is MHL compatible or not? but it\\'s not.If you are buying this mobile only for personal use then it\\'s a good mobile. But if you are looking this mobile for your kid\\'s online class then PLEASE DON\\'T BUY THIS. The phone doesn\\'t meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499. The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance. There is no support for 5Ghz Wi-Fi which is strange to find at this age of mankind. The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppy.The only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration. If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product. Had some expectations. Worst mobile experience. I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back. Such a bad touch screen slogging performance. Nothing is good in this Very bad product.I never think such a product will come from Samsung.It had 48 MP only for show.Photos are not clear .On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one .It gives very low quality photo again.It was my experience.I had bought by dreaming photo clarity.Net work problem is usually Samsung problem here .The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging After a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.However,  as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.After using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manuallyAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of moneyThough the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don\\'t buy it. The performance  drop is so exaggerated. We can\\'t switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum.  Camera quality is bad as well.Edit 2:Worst mobile I have ever bought. Never buy it. There are lots of bugs, wifi calling gets switched off automatically, Sim signal service are irritating. Bluetooth is of inferior quality. Lte settings change automatically. This phone is great! Writing this review after 2 weeks of using.Battery, camera, display all are good...and Battery is 👍.  Here some sample of photos attached.Phone is little bit heavy..for that large battery.Processor is good for daily use...but not for gaming.  Phone 🔊 is also good.Thank you Amazon. Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus. But for the price it definitely is great. Product is okayBut I cancelled order to get discount by paying for the same product by credit card.Disappointed that it was rejected. I\\'m writing this review after using few days I must say samsung m12 is great phone  in  budget segment  compared to vivid v17 and realme 6pro that I\\'m already using  samsung m12 better backup  is excellent after 12hr using only 30% 0f better  used but I\\'m requesting  samsung  to do some important on all cameras  in next update  actually need some improvement  but  I must say in Rs.10999/  this the best samsung m12 phone if anyone thinking to buy samsung m12 please go for it ...but befor that few things I\\'m not happy with phone is1) network connectivity need updated as soon as possible2) Amazon, Amazon prime, flipkart and eew more apps not working bugs is their.3) YouTube also buffering after connected 6mbps speed network4) In the software I think lost of bugs are their need updat as soon as possible. from my side I like it very much thanks samsung for this budget phone  thanks Amazon for one day delivered This phone is not compatible with 5 GHz wifi. I have JioFiber which is having 142 Mbps speed but my wifi network is not visible in phone\\'s WIFI.I called to Samsung customer care and he informed that this phone will be connected to wifi which is having 2.5 GHz.I am returning back this product. Camera picture quality not up to the par! But considering the price range, it is acceptable!But no 5GHz band support! Unacceptable in 2021!!90Hz screen refresh rate does not feel like 90Hz!Lot of lag is present! Don\\'t know if that is a software bug!Battery performance is good!!Speakers are good, as expected.Overall, except the WiFi dual band support issue, rest is acceptable in this price range!! Recently I bought this galaxym12 for Rs.11k. Overall ok. But onething have to remember thst is thickness of the phone. Its 10mm THICK. Just like a brick in your pocket. Overall dimension of the phone also big. Hight , width, especialy thickness. Before i bought i didn\\'t noticed the sizes of the this piece. Thats my mistake too. But u guys please concern about this review before you buy. Otherthan size completly ok at this price. I gave it 4 Stars for the features that do work and not because it\\'s a great phone. Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it\\'s smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn\\'t find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents. Actually i brought this phone on focus to the 6 gb ram, 128 gb storage, 48 mp camera & 6000ah battery. Later on viewing the review of some customer i  was very upset & regreting myself. But when i received the item and my experience on the phone is 100% satisfy with the product. Awesome phone on this price range.Thank amazon & its seller partners, once more thank for courier partner too which help to delivery my item on time & safty.  Thank all Don\\'t get duped by this phone. The description of the phone does not describe wifi support anywhere. Who makes a phone without 5GHz support in the year 2021!!! Apparently Samsung does. This pathetic piece of plastic does not support for 5GHz wifi. Dear friends, believe me. Don\\'t waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can\\'t believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don\\'t believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing. Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon. In dis price u can afford M12 ...no doubt...overall excellent performance Worst product by samsung.Don\\'t buy this mobile.Very slow charging. In one hour charge upto 3 to 4 percent onlyDisplay is too poor qualityDischarge very fast . In a day you have to charge 2 timesCamera is very bad. Very worst phone. Just waste of money and time. I did not any support from Samsung team and Amazon. The battery and charger getting heated up. When I call Samsung customer service they said as you have purchased from Amazon they will not support. Amazon team say that as this a Samsung phone you can call them. They are playing games and I was completely cheated by them. If you purchase from Amazon Samsung team no warranty for this product is only 7 days from the day of purchase.So be careful before you purchase the electronic from Amazon you can get cheated them.I have paid RS 11000 towards this phone. Call button speed:Worst phone speed, it take at least 10 seconds to start dial once you touch the dial button.Face detection:If you put Khichdi mixture on gas , and simultaneously try to unlock phone with face detection, I am sure khichdi will get cooked faster than your face detection.Finger scan unlock-Lock button amd finger scan button are same, and stopped working within month.Camera quality:Sony Ericsson 2Mega pixel cera of 2006 had better clarity than thia camera.Working speed:This phone is winner in speed race, if you remember the tortoise and rabbit story.Moral of the story :Worst phine by samsung Hi Guys, dont buy this mobile. Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I\\'d dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon. Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer. You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff. \"Sir, I am really sorry however, M12 supports 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz.\"- This is the response from Samsung customer service when I inquired why not able to detect to my Router 5G. Even 6K Chinese mobiles have 5G detection - so before you buy think and check as the mobile has very limited features. The battery life is not great while it is 6000.... and camera is very normal standard. The mobile as a whole is a big compromise to the cost and is not a value for money product. Pros :6 gb ram128 gb storagePlus 48 mp back cameraHuge 6000mah batteryLooks are pretty good as wellFingerprint sensor is on the sideCons :Front camera is horribleScreen is not upto the markDue 6k mah battery it is little bit heavyOnly 15 watt chargerNo slow mo or other features in cameraConclusion:If you use it for general use, storage, binge watching it is a great phone but if u are gamer, photo addict, looks then it\\'s not worth it.Although great phone by Samsung in this price range. I bought this phone for reputed brand, 128GB memory, 6 GB RAM.But my bad nothing is working :- It buffers every 5 seconds in each and every audio, video including downloaded videos/audios.- Does not have 5GHz wifi singal acceptance. It shows only 12 Mbps for a 200Mbps fiber comnection for 2.4GHz wifi signal.- Mobile voice network is always low. Voice break always happens, where as all my other mobile works fone.- All applications are very slow and crashes. (Faulty software even after updates).- Sound system including ring tone is very low.- Hotspot goes off multiple times without any reason.- Battery backup 12-14 hours and takes too long to charge- No support from Samsung (Closed 3 tickets without responding)Please don\\'t buy, you will waste yor money. Very disappointed, single band wifi doesn\\'t support 5ghz WIFI band. My 5years old Lenovo k4 note mobile able to connect 5g wifi.  Future is 5g. But this mobile not even supports to connect 5g wifi network I bought Samsung Galaxy M12. Initially, the mobile worked good but for the past 3-4 days the mobile is geting heats up even without using and while charging it hets heats up.Since this mobile carried 1 year warranty for manufacturing device and 6 months warranty for in-box accesories including battery.I request Amazon or Samsung(manifacturer) to replace the said mobile at the earliest. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Battery life has just blown me away impressively... A great screen and a good processor... I play heavy games on it. I\\'m just loving it so much. 90 herts refresh rate at this price... Feels even better than my one plus 7 pro and I feel no difference between this and my s21 ultra Cons-Camera is average.Display dosent feel as smooth as 90 hertz it feels just like normal display.Battery life is ok but not as per 6000 mah only last 1.5 days with moderate usage.Also samsung does not provide any back cover with this mobile so if u buy this mobile do purchase a backcover.Pros-Customisation of samsung is good...lot of themes to change the look of your mobile screen.Buit quality is ok.Sound quality is good.Fingerprint reader is fast.Don\\'t trust Youtubers who are just marketing this mobile for sake of money....These people are biggest frauds. Absolute delight for a budget smartphone! Just ordered it yesterday and got it today within 24 hours. It has it all 6gb RAM 128gb memory. Further two sim slots and a dedicated mem card slot. It\\'s got a 3.5mm headphone jack as well. Also it\\'s got it\\'s own 15w fast charger in box. That is amazing! It\\'s MRP is 15499rs but was in sale in Amazon for 12499rs. A further 10% discount on SBI credit card so deducting 1249rs and another discount on EMI deducted another 440rs and finally got this beast of a phone for just 10803rs! Now isn\\'t that something. Really happy with the purchase as it\\'s for my dad. He too had something to smile about amid this deadly pandamic. Thank u Samsung and thank u Amazon! No need to underestimate exynos 850, with 90Hz refresh rate.it’s not disappointed me. I bought it as second phone(I use iPhone SE 2020).With normal use more then 48hrs still 44% battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it’s so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999/- with ICICI credit card offer.It’s worth buying, it’s far better than other MI with same price (10999-12999 in 4GB -64GB ) as Samsung don’t irritate with adds and also more secured I got this M12 (4 / 64 gb and 6000 battery) as an upgrade to the M01 Core (1 / 16 gb and 3000 battery) phone, in the hope that it would be better ... BUT:1.  battery despite being double the size does not last any longer ..... 50-60% after only1 day of light use (I dont do any social stuff, only 3-5 talks and 1-3 messages per day);2. the ringtone and message notification choice is very poor .... had to import from the old phone;3. could not download ringtones directly to phone, but this may well be more of a problem related with Google;4. software is not friendly, even after 1 full day of struggle, have not been able to locate / access storage card;5. was very happy with the 1 / 16 gb in my earlier phone and never had memory usage beyond about 60%, but this guy eats up more than 2 gb out of the 4 gb RAM even to start with even after i have uninstalled most of the \"apps\";6. one of the reasons of purchasing this was for its USB teethering, which works fine.Bring back the good old button phones (with proper software as 15 years back, and with some improvement in screen / pixels) and get rid of the bloatware.Think. Look, feel and finish of the phone is good and up to the standards of Samsung. I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.Pros:- Fit and finish is very good- Good battery backup- Performance is good with fast response- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant- Responsive finger printing sensor- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls- Clear voice callingCons:- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover- Sound is below average for music listeners- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screenConclusion:Only go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them. It’s a true calling phone ! I gifted my mom this phone in November 2021 and got a better discount for 64GB. Overall it is good, even i feel the size is big but its not that broad while holding it in your hands. Screen quality is good, Camera performs really well in daylight, in low light it suffers a bit and pictures are not that clear and color is also not that accurate. Battery is very good, it goes for more than a day and half (As usage is off-course not that much) but considering the price i believe this is a good choice, Samsung has some bloat ware which you can avoid by unchecking the boxes while setting up at the first time, or delete the apps after your first setup. Rest no major complaints, charger is not turbo charge but it does it work as expected. Thx This phone is amazing for the price. Phone runs smooth considering it\\'s a Exynos 850 Octa core processor. I like the 90Hz screen and I keep it ON all the time.  The fingerprint recognition is extremely fast and reliable. It has a decent camera, the battery is long lasting. The only deal breaker is that it doesn\\'t support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Android 11 with One UI 3.1 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag. One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully. I haven\\'t seen a single ad on my device and I have been using it for almost 3 weeks.It\\'s the best budget phone for the features you get. Doesn\\'t look or feel cheap. So far I ve no issues regarding the producr quality and delivery,it was gud...further comenting after using the product for a week or so...but as revealed above in the pictures,I think I ve got a used or already opened product,I mean whenever I ve bought the product from the store,I ve got it well packed and sealed(in a transparent plastic cover)but here....it is without any covering or seal.Thats why our family never likes to buy such stuff from amazon....flipkart is best for electronic items and gazettes The build feels flimsy and cheap, I got one with a bent display. Unfortunately I never realised this defect until I went to pick up a back case and it wouldn\\'t fit.Back at the Samsung service centre they said it isn\\'t covered under warranty, and I should\\'ve returned it at the time of delivery.Camera is nowhere close up 48MP as claimed, pictures clicked with it are mediocre, to say the least.The only saving grace is the decent battery life.It\\'s a good phone to stay away from though This phone is mostly suited for multimedia, video, internet, office work.Pros-1. Good battery, 2. Connectivity, 3. Knox Security, 3. Design, 4. Price(because samsung mobiles are costlier), 5. Camera, 6. Durability, 7. Side mounted fingerprint, 8. Quick finger print reading, 9. Display (although it\\'s a tft panel but picture quality is quite impressive), 10. Type c, 11. Fast charge, 12. Ui.Cons-1. Heavy weight, 2. Quiet thicker, 3. Processor (heating issue, sometimes heats up without any reason maybe because of background process), 4. Ui lags, could be more optimized, 5. Display (samsung could have given atleast ips panel), 6. Charger(15w charger is not sufficient for a 6000mah battery) 7. Because of ui and processor the battery service becomes very bad which could be good although. I am Samsung user for longest time and despite some negetive reviews, I say best value for money. Only downside are its heavy, but you get use to it and the screen quality. Yes, side by side my other Samsung its a let down, but of its own it\\'s absolutely fine. So, if high quality OLED is must for you then get the one of the other models.Rest no hang issues, does not heat, brilliant battery (as a backup phone on extreme power saver mode it lasted over 5 days!). I got it delivered yesterday. So these are my first impressions after initial setupSize:This is a huge phone. So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed. If you need to use it single handed often, better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesn\\'t fall out. Or go for a small phoneSpeed:It is a bit slow, but you can get used to it. For the price range, it seems to have a decent performance.Audio:This phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but that\\'s only for bluetooth or other audio devices. Not for the phone speaker. Which is kind of a shame. But the audio is not bad.Video/Screen:Blacks are not exactly black. But again, for this price you shouldn\\'t notice those things.Colors are bright***The phone is country locked. So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulatively.I have not tested the other features like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Will update as soon as I do This phone comes with a ton of garbage Apps pre Installed. Samsung appears to be partner with IronSource which is a mobile app advertising company and they will keep bugging you to install tons of non sense apps. Over 10 apps were installed on my phone without my permission or without me asking or agreeing to anything. I did not expect this from Samsung phones, I know this is the case with most chinese phones such as Xiaomi but figures even Samsung comes with such Adwares. I wouldn\\'t have bought this phone if I knew it was an Adware phone. You have been warned. I was looking for a budget phone but didn\\'t want to exceed 10k mark. And eventually I came across this model which was under discount. It was for 9499 and just ordered it right away. I don\\'t have to tell you guya about samsung. The processor is more than capable of handling day to day task with ease. The best part is its battery. It lasts 2 days easily. And the camera is good enough to take photos and selfies. It\\'s a win win. Thanks amazon for the sweet deal. 16/12/21Re-review, after one week of usage, ( learning the product better). I recall my review on12/12/21.Good value for money.  After learning the product and it\\'s  features, I find my choice is worth.I have no idea how the picture quality is coming different & good to first few pictures.I am happy with my purchase.Thanks.__________12/12/21 - not the value for money - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Review is based on first three days use.Reason for this purchase - switching from MotoXForce, due to irreplaceable exhausted battery & incresed ROM need.Rating for Amazon as market place - 4/5. (good display of available options, window shopping, product information, product comparison, communication)Rating for product - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage):One star out of Five - Utter poor camera quality - 48MP quad cam image quality is damn inferior than my previous 24MP MotoXforce image. So unimaginable from Samsung. I find Galaxy S3 images are so fine quality.Battery charging not as fast, as the listing claims.Battery life (6000mAh) - not in tune with expectation, ehausts sooner.Fingerprint reader -  not always recognising. (perhaps the narrow finger print sensor limitation)This is disappointing.I encourage you go for a better option than M12.Thanks. Good one. Serves the purpose. Good phone in budget. Powerful longlasting battery. A bit bulky and a bit slower (compared to higher mid range phones) considering 6GB RAM but you can turn off the animations (by activating developer mode) to make it faster. Still very few apps r a bit slower but that is quite acceptable as it doesn\\'t irritate. Getting 6GB RAM for INR 11500 is awesome. It is not that slow also. Camera is good but shutter speed is slower. Hence, u need to be very steady while clicking pictures in low light else they turn out to be shaky. Nonetheless, a very descent camera in this range. Very difficult to get 6GB RAM Samsung in just 11500. Overall happy about this purchase. Good if u want a phone around 10K. Much better than simply spending 20-30K for few added features. Good if u want a secondary phone for office use (checking emails, etc.). Good for kids online classes. Sturdy enough. If u want non Chinese phone and r getting 6GB RAM in 11500 nothing like it. Just go for it. No regrets. Loving this phone. Packaging - Bad (Though the item was fulfilled, Amazon?). After few days of usage; okay phone. New software.The battery does not feel like 6000mah; last 24-28 hours on low to just mid-level usage.A heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating (while charging).The overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition. ( I have the 6GB/128GB variant and this User Review is on this model ) If you are a NORMAL User like me....who does not play any Games or doesn\\'t use the phone camera much......and just use it to phone call, binge some movies or TV Shows or listen to some quality music, then this phone is EXCELLENT for Usage. Go for the 6GB/128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system. The display is good for viewing too... not too bad. PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE:1) Android 11 out of the box, ONE UI CORE 3.1 is awesome and simplistic.2) It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference.3) The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you won\\'t even notice anything.4) Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good.5) Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful.6) The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery, and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtube.The charging time is worth it for the battery duration. This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14, which is great. The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness. The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations. A GREAT FULL ON PACKAGE FOR A NORMAL USER.

I have only expressed my anguish and helplessness in not getting redressal of my grievances. It\\'s very bad that the sound in my phone is not working in just less than 1 month of purchase. We have warranty and Samsung may rectify the issue but who is responsible for the trouble we faced for two or three days. Samsung slowly going down and they can lose market share if they do not take an action on sellers who are selling defective pieces. 1 is the highest score that I can give but this phone is deserved for 0 or less. Superb..... Great speed.... and photos clarity. Loving ...... Battery last 100% charge, using since 2 days... Yet at 23% . Banking , payment security 👍. Camera 😘🥳, Speed ❤️❤️, All quality of phone , as name Samsung is Enough 👍❤️❤️❤️. Brand is Brand. Price range 👍🥰🥰. Finger print sensor 💪🏃⛷️⛷️⛷️superb. I will rate phone for this price range 95. As only 2 colour options available. This phone is not listed on Exchange models while buying a new phone which means Samsung has delisted its own product. That\\'s how Junk this product is for Samsung. Amazon says exchange is listed by seller. We buy from Amazon and not Samsung. Add some more money and buy better products then electronic junks on Sale especially Mobile Phones.Sale period defective and faulty units are rolled out otherwise a new product cannot have problems within a month. There are only 2 buttons in a smart phone and that also most important one goes bad or was missing parts. You will waste money even in warranty - they charge pickup drop as travelling 10kms during covid and wasting half day in queue is a disaster.That\\'s why Samsung sales suffer in Mobile phone markets------------------------------------------within 20 days the fingerprint scanner button stops working. initially looked good. it seems they are reselling used phones which can work until return window is closed. Amazon has zero liability post return window and they dumped junk Overall the phone is good...huge screen size and battery life is superb! However, I have been facing issues with the performance of the phone. At times it runs slow, inspire of having just the basic apps installed. There are also instances where when I have to click the send button which in some apps is located on the top, it automatically takes me to another app!The only way to solve this issue then is by restarting the phone...and this happens on a daily basis. I have tried reformatting the phone to resolve the issue but it still remains. Also the colours of the photos arnt as dynamic as compared to the Samsung S10. Its like a pure Samsung stock Android phoneEverything is customisable ,its easy to use no lags or glitchesGames run smoothly COD , Asphalt 9 etcCall Quality is goodThere is no wifi 6 feature ( not everyone has wifi 6 at home yet)Overall a great simple phone must buy!!!! Just Rs 10,000/- In an affordable range this is a good phone to purchase. Loved the way it performes with its special features like 90hz display speed 6000mh battery and decent camera quality. If someone compares it with high budget phones and criticize then for them better to go expensive. Overall it\\'s a great budget phone 📱.. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Tik tik soung of plastic coming from charging jack/slot area..may be because of not sealing the phone properly or their is a gap inside. And sometimes my phone is fully charged and and charger is not attached then its showing at the bottom charged 92 % and remaining time of fully charge is showing 24 minutes. Bought this for my Dad. Its good enough for general use.Pros:1. Performance : Its fast enough for general use. Did not notice much lag in UI.2. Features : Has more features than my Samsung F41, like camera macro mode.3. Battery : Lasts long.4. Weight : Has some weight but it doesn\\'t feels so when in hand.Cons:1. Software : Somewhat buggy. The keypads in Upi app doesn\\'t show up completely.2. Camera : Average quality. Indoor photos have noise. Also, its takes a bit time to process the image after capture.Overall, its good budget phone for general use and not for extensive use.Recommended! I would say it\\'s a decent mobile for the price.*Battery is outstanding*Display could have been better*Camera is decent and obviously can\\'t expect more for the price.*90HZ really makes this phone special.*5g is not available, that\\'s kinda disappointing.*The phone is also kinda heavy.Overall, a mediocre mobile phone for the price. After having used an Mi A2 for about 2 years, this phone was a step down. The prices are similar, and both phones are 4G/64GB.Found this samsung phone thicker, heavier and slower. UI is a bit sluggish. Clear chat on whatsapp is almost always slow (it was very quick on Mi A2). Googlepay PIN keypad does not render properly (some numbers are cropped). A2 has dual speakers with better sound, and a qualcomm processor.The pros of M12 are : display is nicer, the battery is better, and the camera quality is better (don\\'t like the auto play of videos in camera app, haven\\'t found a way to turn it off yet).If I were to choose between the two, would go with Mi A2 (lighter, sleeker, faster, better sound). Wonderful product. Power packed. Very handy. Easy to operate. Light weight. Value for mon ey. Excellent phone I have ever come across. Powerful battery lasting very long between recharges. I used it for whole day still battery dropped very little. Amazing. No heating  up of battery even after long continuous usage. Very sleek and thin design. Large RAM  and ROM. Delivery by Amazon was on time. Overall five stars without any hesitation. Purchased mobile on 12th April 2021. IMEI number blocked on 20th April 2021. Enquired with Amazon they just simple told, replacement period over, not able to return the item.Again enquired with Samsung authorized service centre, they told it\\'s a defective product, please discuss with amazon customer care, they only able to replace the item.If this product is purchased from Shop (offline) , maximum 14 days validity for replacement.Now need to change the mother board, it will take minimum 15 days. myself helpless from amazon. Please try to avoid the purchase from amazon. No doubt it is a good smartphone but I was a MI user before and now facing some problem and some features are missing.here are my reviews on M12:Bettery backup is best ,camera quality normal but front camera is good. Screen size is very big for your pocket,Brightness is harmful for eyes in night eyeprotector is useless, you can add only 3  fingerprint for lock and sensor is wrost place at a very odd position, silence key is missing, 4 camera is a myths, 48mp camera also a myth,  for MI user: no magnitometer it means no compass for North South,  working.  When put earphone no icon show at above you can\\'t know plugged in or not, power button doesn\\'t off the flash light, 3 finger screenshot not working here, C-type charger so you have to take charger everywhere. OTG not supported,  heavy weight, Camera have very limited features like no timelaps video option, no grid view, no screen focus option.  It is a good phone if it will your first phone then it\\'s OK but if you are MI user then in my opinion don\\'t go for this ....... Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost. Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered. Happy shopping. If you ask me, the phone worth it if you are looking for 5G in Samsung brand. With a couple of great specks like Samsung\\'s #FastestMonster equipped with the blazing fast Snapdragon 750G processor. It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videosCons: though Super AMOLED Infinity-U 6.6” display gives a true-to-life to mobile, indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one. At last even I don’t like the in-screen security as it would not work as expected, that maybe I have not used to it since I am trying 1st time and I am blind person though. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0🤡Good camera, 🔴Nice Build Quality and Excellent Ram Management. 👀Performance of 6000🔋 Mah Battery Life For 2 Days Enough With Single Charge. Its Really Monster. 🗑️Overall It is Perfect 📱Smartphone for Every One. Finger Print Senser and Face Lock is Very Fast. 👍🔴Excellent work by samsung in 2021.🎱 Pros1. Big display phone2. Very good battery life3. Not heating on usage4. Good sound/audio5. For my usage,  good processing speed and good RAMCons1. Touch screen is not very accurate- I am having to click on a button multiple times to get it clicked2. Like, MI, Samsung has Samsung apps that though useless to me constantly keep running and updating and occupy memory and cannot be deleted3. Brightness control is not good - max brightness and min brightness have less difference4. Camera is ok I bought Samsung to get less bloated OS but Samsung has gone shameless like it\\'s peers MI and realme. OS is bloated and I hate the skin. I\\'m going to install a custom rom after a year.I bought it for my mom, she doesn\\'t know how to protect her privacy and data and Samsung is exploiting it. Shame.I disabled these apps(in photo), I use micro g services instead of Google, but I can\\'t disable some Samsung apps. I\\'m writing this review after 1 month of use. here is what is faced in this 1month span.cons :1. Auto-restart sometimes without information.2. Messages app having every time.3. Battery is average.4.90 Hz refresh rates stuck your phone.5. Charging Takes 2 hours. the charger is 9w, not 15w.6. Video Quality compromised.7. No App lock inbuilt.8. Installing Google Apps takes a little bit of time.Pros:1. Good and stylish Design.2. smooth User InterFace3. Animations while calling are very descent.Last but not Least At this price This is the best I saw. I know it\\'s so many complications but it\\'s the best mobile at this price.Thanks. It took me an hour to set up the phone as all the pre installed aps were updating one after the other, making the phone lag. After setup, I had to uninstall all the unnecessary app in order to ensure smooth running of the phone. Each time I try and install a low graphic game the phone starts lagging. The RAM is incapable to handle any low end gaming.  The phone is very bulky and the hands start to hurt if you\\'re watching any video content. All in all, its not what I wanted it to be. Thumbs down! This is by far the worst phone from Samsung. I upgraded from old Galaxy on7 pro to this one because it promised better OS, better screen refresh rate, better storage and better camera quality. But to my dismay, none of these is a wow factor in this phone except for battery life. The phone hangs every 5-10mins with only 2 apps running. The screen response rate is pathetic and camera quality below par, not sure what they mean by 48MP camera. Don\\'t take this phone even if someone offers it to you for free. It\\'s a headache more than a utility. I would urge Amazon to bring down such a pathetic product from their website because it will spoil their brand name as well. I took this mobile for the battery performance.. and it was one of best phone i ever seen.. last month it was taking upto 2 days to drain the battery... then after one update.. it became worst it is taking only 20 hrs to drain complete battery.. and during night time also it is taking around 25 % battery. before update it was taking hardly 1 % battery in night times..worst part of the software it is not even showing which app takes more battery..With the latest update the battery and phone performance got very good..Camera is improved a lot..auto brightness setting is still take lots of time to settle.. sometimes it does not works need to adjust manually..Overall best phone with price point.. Got this phone for my dad who loves YouTube and watching news.Pros: Great battery life (need charging once in two days with moderate use), Supports fast charging, No Androidware thus very smooth UI and no lag, excellent 4 camera in rear and brilliant front facing camera, Runs on latest Android and processor is quite peppyCons: Slightly bigger in length and little heavy compared to others, Future Android upgrades not clear, Not 5G enabledTips: I got this phone under 9.5K so wait for the right deal. Good phone for average daily use. I am slightly disappointed as wifi calling feature is missing. My old M30 had wifi calling two years ago. Also, the call volume is very low, I have to press against my ear to listen to calls. Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 6.5-inch HD+ Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution. The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset. Simply you better to skip this phone I break my old screen so suddenly I need to buy I brought this because I get it in good price but after I receive I realized it\\'s simple useless 🤣 my old 3gb ram phone (I brought in 2018) 100 times better than this it\\'s easily struck most of time touch doesn\\'t working screen just break because I sleep on it you can\\'t play pubg in it no games you can\\'t use much outside in summer or do work much it\\'s easily shut down phone easily over heat many problems .. people who need phone for simple thing like calling watching YouTube better to buy this - Processor is good and all the apps works perfectly, doesn\\'t hangs, multiple apps could run without abruptly closing or need to close.- Best for people who don\\'t want to make use of heavy apps like snapchat- Camera quality is okay not so good when compared to M21. But looking at the cost of the phone this feature is justified.- Supports normal and wifi video calling without any issues- Speaker sound is okay, same cost factor- Two features which I feel are thereal drawbacks.  Finger print sensor is from the  side power button which is just below the volume button so you need to press it very carefully else it asks for phone restarting or switching off.- Second is not a real major one but the phone is very heavy in weight.- Battery life is okay you may continuosly watch movie or videos or use phone for 6-8 hours, takes 2 hours for full charging. Phone gets heat up in 1-1.5 hours of continuous use.- Display is good- Face ID works better than finger print.- Call recording and voice calling are clear- Have port for ear phones.- Hotspot feature is okay because phone started heating up when I turned hotspot on.- No network issues with either of the nano SIM To be honest i was totally skeptical whether i should buy this phone or not,  seeing so many negative comments, I took the risk and bought it..After using the phone aggressively for 2 days i must say as i read from the reviews that this phone Hangs on operation which is totally FALSE .Phone totally works fine. Having a refresh rate of 90Hz the phones doesn\\'t show any delay, the UI is smooth battery is quite strong . Using aggressively at max only consumed 46% of battery in two days (discharged from 100% to 54%).The only thing that will disappoint you is its Camera Which works like a 6-8MP camera.Macro shots are not that detailed either.Front camera is just like having a 2-3 MP camera.Samsung should have uplifted camera quality when they mentioned it with 48MP camera.This phone will disappoint you in terms of camera quality.Rest the phone just works very well in terms of other configurations. This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance. I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display . Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didn\\'t . They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos. But still this is the best phone under this budget. Better that A21s of Samsung . It\\'s the best 10k budget phone now. Don\\'t get confused with f12 it\\'s just same as M12. Awesome budget phone with all the features that is required for daily use like 6000 mah battery which last upto 1 day after internet serving, watching videos, listening music and lot more.Screen resolution and screen size is really well in this budget and you can\\'t expect better than this within this budget.Processor is also good for normal and average use, its not made for playing heavy graphics game like PUBG, COD, Asphalt etc. You can go for it if you are looking for something with a decent spec and long lasting quality.I\\'m a samsung user, I am using samsung since last 9+ years and I can claim that samsung gives the best quality product amongst all the other brands except Apple.Camera perfomance is really well as per 48 mp. The only thing is its bit unstable in night time. You may require some extra light for taking pictures in night. Too good too purchase.PROS:1. CAMERA fantastic camera. With 48 Mega Pixels. Low light pictures are better than any other Realme or redmi type Chinese mobile. Even it\\'s good than OPPO.2. PROCESSOR Too good. Better than any other Mobile under Rs 10000.3. Screen : Don\\'t read review of other people. You will never realize it\\'s Oled or else. Screen is good.4. RAM. You will get pure 4GB free RAM with 4GB model. In Realme or Redme you will find  half RAM already full.5. Battery: Battery is too good. I used it full day after full charged. No need to connect to charger in the evening. Charged it next day when you feel free. Even it can play YouTube for half hour with only 2%  battery.6: FM : Fm recording available with good quality.CONS.1 If you play high grafic game for more than 1 hour than it will lag for 10 to 15 second.2 No screen recording. But you can download any application from Playstore or Samsung store.3 Not having magnetic sensor. That\\'s why not good for traveller. It will not show you north direction. You will face difficulty to know the accurate direction of your target.Conclusion : Don\\'t go for any other Mobile brand upto 11k. Go for this SAMSUNG mobile.  M12 or F12. It is working as per the specifications. The phone is getting strucked in the middle of while continuously the application usage is getting struck for a second,I have to close the application once and again I have to open the particular application It is only drawback I faced in this mobile. Apart from that the sound quality picture quality and video quality all are good as per the cost provided for the mobile. As I purchased this mobile during the Amazon great Indian festival on 7th October. I purchased this mobile through online using card as offer applied and I purchased at 8500 change. It is affordable for normal mobile price  from Samsung brand. If u want to use for normal use it is good mobile. If u want to use for high level games and all it is not Okey.  So you can go for other mobile model as per your need. Bought it under 10k (black colour) . Average performance overall. You will get charger 15w,charging cable(which is shortjn length) and user manual in the box.No case is provided in the box recommended to buy one with it. Body is made of plastic which is of low quality, black one looks decent compare to other colours.Pros:1.Battery life is awesome(2 day backup for me on moderate usage) .2.Display quality is great (better viewing angle)with good audio support.3. There is dedicated micro SD card slot available.4. Type c port.Cons:1. Phone is heavy and thick, you can feel the weight  when you are using it. But will get used it after few hours.2. Camera is below Average, not a camera centric phone.3. OS is laggy, you can feel it sometimes when you are using it. Samsung One UI is great but it makes it laggy.4. Can\\'t do any heavy gaming, average game can be possible.5. Battery takes time to charge, but drains really slow. Lasted 2 days in full recharge. More than 2 hours to charge fully.Overall this phone is good for media consumption only. The features offered by this device at the price range are fabulous. There is no lag during the usage. The display is good for watching youtube, netflix etc. The camera is decent w.r.t. the price at which you get it. For gaming, it is optimized for no lag.Perfect optimized performance at this price range. Call quality and speakers are good enough. Everything is good in this phone camera is okay in daylight means if your facing the source of light your photo will be good but at night the photos are poor and there is no other problem but I was disappointed because the company says true 48MP camera and it has quad camera setup but the photos are not up to mark the photos of my redmi 9 prime which has 13MP QUAD Camera setup are excellent far better than m12 Excellent product, ensure you use non-chinese products because of the SAR values.The SAR values mentioned by chinese manufacturers are fake, they are far higher than what is mentioned.. It is always better to use from reputed brands because they follow min ethics.If anyone is facing sluggish UI.. do this--Enable developer options> look for animations> disable the animations.Your phone will work like superfast.. I got it for 8999 with bank discount, very good phone for the price. Battery is awesome,it lasts for 9 hour continuous video Play and 1.5 day nirmal use.15W charger charges fast.Fingerprint on side is fast and it\\'s easy to unlock then phone on table. Other phones have fingerprint at back side which is useless.Camera quality isnt that good but it\\'s okay.Only problem is Samsung installs unwanted apps without permission. It installed the paisabazaar app without my permission. The \"paisabazaar\" and \"policybazaar\" are the biggest scammers in India. Camera quality is awesome, no compromise on the quality.Battery life is excellent, for my usage of approx 20 nos long call of 5 - 20 mins average, and corporate emails.... Usage the battery is lasting for almost 3 full days. Battery is seriously a Monster.Fingerprint reader is an average one... No comments!!!  Overall for the price of 10k (i got 2k discount from amazon and 1k for using icici card) this is an excellent product from Samsung. Also to mention the Android v11 is loaded... No compromise in security related flaws. Excellent phone... Go for it!!!!! PROS: 1) VERY BIG BATTERY. CASUAL USE CAN GIVE BATTERY BACKUP UPTO 2 AND HALF DAYS 2) BUILT QUALIY IS AWESOME. 3) VERY ATTARCTIVE PRICE POINT BELOW 10K CONS:1) LCD DISPLAY CAN NOT PRODUCE SHARP AND VIVID QUALITY PICTURE2)VERY HEAVY PHONE (YOU CAN BUILT  MUSCLE AFTER USE OF 2 TO 3 YEARS).😂😂3) SLOW PHONE AFTER FUELD WITH 4GB AND 64GB.MADE IN INDIA PRODUCT.(NO CHINESE BRAND IS PLUS POINT) This is a good phone for people who generally use mobile for some social networking and calling.Camera - great at this prices, 48 MP quad cam.. Well done.Dual sim and a dedicated sim card slot... Great.Overall a nice product for parents. Writing this review after using this for complete 1 month..1-🔋 Life really good I can say it\\'s awesome which lasts long for complete more thn a day watching videos/movies, playing games, connected to WiFi and Bluetooth all day long..2- Display is big enough to enjoy watching videos/ movies, playing games same as Sony Xperia\\'s lates variants Sony Xperia 1 ii, 1 iii, 10 ii, 10 iii and all which is 21:9 cinematic view3- Touch is also very good it\\'s very smooth and an actual feel of 120 refreshing HZs..4- Though it comes with quad camera 48, 5, 5 and 2 MP it\\'s not up to the mark, camera quality is very poor as compared to other phones which comes under 15K. I bought this phone along with the similar priced Xiaomi Note variant and the difference is absolutely noticeable.The fingerprint does not work, at all!The wifi calling feature of the phone is worse than the actual mobile network (which is pathetic in itself)!WhatsApp will not work, all throughout the day.I suggest ya\\'ll go with the usual competitors and ignore Samsung in the cheaper range, altogether! A decent phone but not meant for heavy tasking..Screen is  decent..Samsung UI is working good.Sound is Decent ..Charging time is little bit Higher due to huge battery ( Approx 3 Hours for 0-100%)and charging wire is very small.Camera is good.Fingerprint Scanner is decent.Phone is little bit Heavy but its easy to handle.Phone is for  normal user not for gaming as sometime phone feels that exynos 850processor is not providing full power. Pros:1. Perfect battery life...lasts you till 1.5 day with heavy usage.2. 90Hz display is smooth.3. The software is excellent...everything just flows..from school through settings to multi-tasking is smooth 👌Cons:1. This phone is very heavy and thiccc...2. Phone lags while doing heavy usage.3. Camera is just below average 🙄 at 11,000....4. Phone heats up very quickly.5. Display quality is just OK because of HD+....better to buy Redmi 9 Power OR POCO M3Verdict: It is better to buy REDMI 9 POWER IF YOU WANT AN 1. BEST BATTERY2. FULL HD+ DISPLAY3. BEST CAMERA WITH 48MP4. FAST CHARGER IN-THE BOX...22W FAST CHARGER5. 4GB+64GB  -OR-POCO M31. BEST BATTERY2. FULL HD+ DISPLAY3. BEST CAMERA WITH 48MP4. FAST CHARGER IN-THE BOX...22W FAST CHARGER5. AND WITH 6GB RAM 😱+ 64GB I had bought this phone for my father-in-law. He is pretty satisfied with the performance. Battery life is amazing for him (he does not use phone much, apart from occasional calling and receiving calls, and checking whatsapp twice daily), and he is getting 3-3.5 days of battery-life after one full charge.We know that we can get better phones from other brands in this range, but for elderly, the ease of use of Samsung OneUI is really a tipping factor for deciding on this phone. This model has similar features as other Samsung mobiles. The camera quality is not that great but I don\\'t mind I don\\'t click much pictures anyway, it\\'s not the best camera but it\\'s not that bad. In this price range, I think this is the best deal I\\'ve got 6GB RAM, 128 internal memory, expandable up to 1TB with 6000mAH battery and I must say battery life is amazing.Since I trust the brand I always go for Samsung. Unnecessary apps automatically download on their own. We can\\'t control them. Any number of times you uninstall them, again, they will download and install without our role. There are no settings in phone to control them. Very nuisance.Screenshot is not working.  Overall working and performance is not up to mark even for this price level. Some other model from Samsung or other brands or honor are best alternatives. Samsung refused to replace screen citing physical damage. As the entire phone is already covered under warranty for any factory defects, there was no need to mention 6 month free screen replacement separately. Had I known this, I would have taken an Insurance. This is clearly a very bad customer experience from a well known brand like samsung. In my eyes, it has already tranished the high brand image for samsung I had. I feel deeply cheated. I don\\'t have any games on my phone and no sm app apart from twitter. My phone usage about 98 % comprises of reading my mails and attachments i.e. pdf, doc, xls files etc. and voice calls. Overall my phone usage is less since I work from home mostly from my laptops. But the battery drain is visible within just 3 months of use. The use of mobile internet is also low and I usually work with wifi but the power drain is significant while using internet. I have checked if any app is draining battery but didn\\'t find anything. All this claim of 6000 mah is disappointing. I will probably take my phone to the service centre soon. Amazing blue colour,If you need battery backup phone and have extream use of phone stock market trader like me, go for it without second thought. Superb battery. 100% would last 1.5 or 2 days.Processor is not good enough to handle game. So it\\'s not gaming phone.Screen refresh rate is quite good.I returned my third class POCO F1 in 8k by cashify and bought this one. I got good deal.Camera quality is not good enough.. you need to on 48mp always. The phone is excellent. The call quality is good too. Everything is satisfactory or much better than expected.The major glitch, however, is non-operational USB tethering. It simply doesn’t work.So if you want a phone that needs to be taken to the service station the minute you switch it on, if you cannot live with a faulty phone or if you must have USB tethering, keep away from this Samsung. Maine ye cell 17 ko order diya aur 19 ko mujhe recive hua. 3days use karne ke baad mera review-Phone ka Camera aur battery super hai, screen size bhi pocket friendly hai, battery backups almost 2days.Mujhe isme kuch basic kamiyan lagi jo is prise range me nahi hona chahiye, jaise aap net ka speed screen me nahi dekh sakte kyunki setting me option hi nahi hai, isme net bhi slow chal raha hai. Speed show nahi hone se pata hi nahi chalta ki problem cell me hai ya sim network me. Mere likhane cell me idea 4g ka speed achha tha leki. Isme nahi hai. Overall mujhe bahut jyada khushi nahi hui is cell se, jabki maine Samsung ka naam dekh kar m12 purchase kiya. Please Samsung dhyan de. Samsung M12 is not worth it\\'s price due to various shortcomings faced by me. (1) FINGER PRINT SCANNER DOESN\\'T WORK PROPERLY Position of FP scanner on right side (unlike backside of phone in Samsung A21s & other models) fails FP Scanning. And if mobile has a backcover if the one recommended by Amazon at order stage, then FP scanner will fail you. (2) FACE RECOGNITION ALSO DOESN\\'T WORK Most of the time Samsung M12 doesn\\'t recognize my face. (Looks it doesn\\'t like my face with which no problem on Samsung A21s). (3) CONTACT PHOTO IN RECENT CALLS FEATURE REMOVED Recent calls appear without Contact Photo. With Recent Call feature in other models it was easier to search & Call numbers from Recent Calls List. (4) STORAGE 4.94 GB of Internal Storage & 7.13 GB of SD Card being shown as Used by OTHER details of which no where. No way available to scan this storage usage & remove unnecessary OTHER consuming Internal & SD Card Storage. (5) NOTIFICATIONS NOT APPEARING ON LOCK SCREEN Despite trying my best Notifications from various apps do not appear on Lock Screen. All settings, including of Lock Screen tried without any success. Think before finalizing Samsung M12. First, Samsung\\'s reliability and second, I ordered this product by combining them with so much emotion that even if I don\\'t want to understand, then I will return it because I will definitely be heard here and when I ordered it, I understood that I have got a very good product and I am very satisfied with it, I gifted it to my brother, he used it regularly, there is no problem of any kind, you guys must also take it M12 is fulfilled my expectations completely, hats off to Samsung. Quality camera and fingerprint reader are best of this range. Especially big battery gives good support for online classes without interruption, totally we are well satisfied with product. Good buy within the price  range, this thing is powerfull, the one\\'s looking for performance this is the product, 6 gb ram with 128gb to access with is worthy. The system has variety  of settings to choose from, this might get slow when google drive is being used for contacts and other things as it directly fetches data from drive but there are other settings you can play with and enjoy games at a very good speed.. And the charger is powerful.Recommendation for games: try games from ppsspp emulator. I am writing this review after 3 days of usage. I have upgraded to this phone from a Redmi 5A. Looks and feel are simply amazing. The usage experience is also superb. The battery life seems to be v v long, when compared to my last phone. Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. Seems like a real upgrade from my old Redmi 5A... and, to top it all, Amazon gave me an exchange offer worth Rs. 2500 on my 3 year old Redmi 5A... I have nothing to complain.Last but not the least, the delivery experience was also superb... delivered within 2 days !!! And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to him.Overall a 5 star experience... However, I would have loved to give a 6-star for battery life as well as the delivery experience. Writing this after 4 months if heavy usagePros:-1. Very very big battery life. This battery is so big that you can easily use it for 2days with moderate use.2. Very beautiful screen even though it is LCD. Samsung has not used any cheap screen. You can enjoy your Movies and Web-Series.3. Very good camera ultra wide mode is just so beautiful you don\\'t need panaroma mode in this. Selfie camera is just awesome .4. You even get headphone jack.5. The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching.6. I have played games like BGMI, CODM, NFS with ease.My final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes, play games, or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher. You can download almost 70 movies with ease. I am a student  .first time I thought  to purchased a smartphone  from.my first salary . I waited for Diwali to get offer price . I searched  all over the internet  to get a budget smartphone  ....but I don\\'t want to compromise  with RAM, ROM ,Battery Mah and must Made in India.....At last I got to know about this smartphone....which gives 6 gb Ram, 128 gb internal storage,  and 6000mah.....I satisfied 100 percent.  I never expected  to get this at just 10000 only from Samsung ..... Samsung m12 gives smooth performance. Its 48 mp camera is good but the quality of image it captures is low quality.It has a long battery of 6000 mah. While charging phones heats up. But within a few minutes,it cools down.Overall it is a good phone in 11,000/-Update: 6 may 2021Now its one and half month is over and it has started to heat up  unecessary during charging.🙄Update : 4th July 2021The phone is not taking charging instead it is draining the battery. I does not expected this type of issue with #samsung. This is really irritating that I ordered this phone as brand new and within few months now the power button is not working. When I took out to the service center they r saying it is open piece and blaminge that I have opened it. They need money to replace the cap inside the button. Never expected this from Amazon to give me a used piece or Samsung service center is playing a game for money. What would you expect witha battery of the size 5000, that it should be great. Well it okay not that great.I think due to the size of the battery the phone feels quite heavy.Camera: let me say this bluntly that the camera is not great it okiesh time. Didn\\'t expect this from the Samsung company.I know the prize is less but didn\\'t expect the camera to be that bad.If you are going to buy it for battery performance then you may go for it. My review after receiving mobile..Dont think that samsung phones are hang every time.. the thing is how you dealing with the phone is matters with any brand...Rear/ selfi Camera - awesome performance (daylight conditon) 4.5/5Battery - 4/5Display- 4/5And unexpected features comes within it in this price range bcz it comes with android 11 latest version...90hz refresh rate👍working good.Side fingureprint sensor - fastIt support dual volte network...Awesome productThank you samsung for this monster reloaded smart phone...Don\\'t worry guys go for it... A great device (on the heavy side) for general usage.Ordered for mom who uses WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube. Battery lasts for at least 2 days easily.The camera quality is good enough for this price range and good to see the latest Android 11 onboard. 4 years of updates makes it worth the investment for long term usage. Average phone considering price range.1. Camera quality: average, no slow motion or time lapse feature available, no zoom when using 48mp. Front camera, below average. Sometimes I take a photo that doesn\\'t get stored, quite annoying.2. Weight: quite heavy, you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand.3. screen type: lcd not led or amoled4. Batter life: looks good with normal usage.5. Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that. Also, I use night model, where it gets better into grayscale in night, I can\\'t customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want, also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it. Not an easy option provided.Face recognition: not fast and accurate. I was looking for solid battery backup phone.. and I found one. M12 is awesome in battery backup,  display is great. Finger print sensor is flawless..Overall a good second phone for my needs..This is going to be a great,Samsung budget phone..I had one incident too , I slipped the phone in a bucket full of water,  I took it out immediately and its working fine... Overall 3star.. very bulky and a slightly heavier phone. Could work on the bulk and weight of the phone. After a few updates the phone slows down. Samsung needs to work on the performance of the phone. I have been using the phone for 2 months now (6gb ram 128gm rom) and I feel that the performance has slowed in just 2 months. At times there is lag and the phone screen stops responding completely. The pages get stuck and the screen touch also gets weird.Problem areas to sum up1) heavy 2) bulky 3) touch screen is not that great4) slowness of the phoneGood things1) battery life (as of now) 2) camera 3) finger print reader 4) ok phone for basic usage The overall look of the phone is good.The features available at this pricing is excellentThe camera quailty is a bit disappointing specially the front camera.There are very few button option and many are missing which is available in the button menuLot of features are also missing in camera.Battery life is very very good listening to music watching movies and day long games .Overall a good phone at the given price rangeHappy to be a SAMSUNG mobile Fan I purchased it for the 6GB+128GB combination. Though knowing that the processor capacity could be less. But it is indeed a surprise. 6 GB RAM effect is clearly visible apps launch too fast, scrolling too smooth.Have been using it only for 3 days .. but initial feedback is quite good.I should also mention Delivery - superb!. I ordered at night 11pm. next day 11am the phone was with me. Truly.. Kudos to Amazon team - suppliers, delivery and all combined. it is lightning fast.. and really nice. Greetings, This mobile is a PREMIUM variant in budget/Basic smart phone.The main attraction is the exynos Processor (Samsung flag ship Brand) which offers Pristine call Quality and Great Reception.Who can buy it?A person who is looking for a reliable, Long run,Basic smartphone for what\\'s app /Video calls and Working in remote areas where they get weak signals.Recommend for :Working professionals, Sr.Citizens and Kids(Online classes).Not Recommend for Gamers and who spend most of the day with mobile apps Iam not a gaming user...so first of all this review is only for normal users...1.Very importantly  the battery stands so strong from its competitors.2.Display though lcd HD+, is so good from all viewing angles.3. I just love the side mounted fingerprint and power button but may be difficult  for some new smartphone users4.camera though  not great, at this price point it stands stronger than  its competitors with all four cameras5.colour variants of phone can be even more optional for users (as of now only three courses two usual colors and one slightly different colors.6.speaker is usual loud but not so great since it\\'s competitors atleast gives surround speakers at this price point. But clarity of sound is great,but bass lovers wouldn\\'t  love these speakers.7.Actually the expectation  and reality  of Samsung  exynos processor  changed my opinion  on their processor...it was great 👍...u will definitely  love it...8. One UI stands apart from all its competitors(especially mi ui ads on mi phones)It was my own experience and review with the phone...If iam wrong at any points peoples can comment me with correct ones so that users buy a better smartphone...Tq Battery backup very good. Some features are very helpful, that is tap to wake up & screen off, eye comfort shield, dark mode, Dolby atmos. Transfer massages, contacts, settings, notes, app data are very easy from my old Samsung phone. Overall experience very good. Good quality Samsung phone for general use (6gb ram/128gb). Android 11 out of the box, which is important for security and software compliance/updates for a londer time. Good camera. Excellent battery life (2.5- 3 days with non gaming, sparse content viewing). Better than cheap chinese wannabes in quality and comes with Samsung reliability amd latest Android 11, even though it may be nominally behind in a specification or two.. Product is not working properly got replaced but the issue is still presist and will not be rwolved in near future.I do not that how may buyer are receiving this issue bit I am getting that issue.In phonepe when I enter upi pin that keyboard number are cutting in half size.That is the issue and heating so on..Sound tones are changing automatically.Loud speaker is not working on call. No voice come out in laud speaker on call..:( Got it in Big billion days offer ₹8500. In this price category the phone is good.Screen and battery are Good.Camera quality is below average.Lots of unwanted applications pre-installed. But you can uninstall some of it.There is no back cover and screen guard in the box.Phone feels little heavier.Its ok for minimal usage. Not for heavy mobile users. Everything about this phone is good but there are some problems also like processor is bit slow so you will see a very small lag b/w input and output. Too much heavy and width is also too much and it definitely don\\'t looks like 2021 model phone bcz of weight and width of phn specially when technology has so advanced that there are too slim and light weight phns available in the market; it took like phn is from 2015 something. Screen\\'s performance is definitely not upto the mark.I\\'m a student and I  generally use laptop for much of my work and uses mobile very little, so can\\'t give that much detailed review about everything but yeah I can say one thing that  if you are a student than it will definitely serve the purpose for which you will buy it. My earlier m31s stopped working suddenly, and in order to have a backup during lockdown purchased this one. It is budget friendly if bought in sale. Same as other phones in size (which are being launched lately). speed and memory in sync. However, camera and finger print scanner a big turn off. Dont go for it if camera / pics are main purpose or you use that often. Got it for 9.5kIt deserves 9k as other brands are selling same phones at such price.Battery backup is the primary reason for buying this.48 MP camera does not give good quality pics. Its just that they have faked by increasing the MP of camera without actually improving image quality.4 camera is useless. Anybody would use only one camera. So its better to give just one camera with good quality rather than to give 4 average cameras. It\\'s the worst phone I have ever seen. The build quality is really poor. And speakers of the would will give you a night mare. We can\\'t hear the phone even if it\\'s in your pockets . Speakers are toooo low. I would definitely not recommen this phone. Instead opt for mi or anyother brand where you would get tons of features at this price. I feel regret buying this phone. After using this mobile for 2 months I would say its an ordinary mobile for adults who are average users.As i said its an average mobile, good call clarity and user interface.Overall mobile is quite slow (you wont feel like its 4G RAM) even the contact search will take few seconds.Camera is below average 48 mega pixel is not upto the mark (I have used 48 mega pixek redmi note 7 pro) video clarity is very bad, selfie camera is the worst.Macro lens is not clear.Irrespective of the apps you use it will be slow. I don\\'t play games but for sure its not suitable for playing heavy games.Battery is good will come for more than 2.5 days with normal usage. Best for elders.Display is okay.Side mounted finger print sensor is cool.Price is quite high with the above drawbacks. The phone has good battery better than most other phones.The performance is not upto the mark. Camera doesn’t look like 48 pixel.Writing 48 pixel camera, 6GB RAM and not experiencing such level of performance based on specs raises doubts on Samsung.Definitely compare with other phones in the before marking a purchase decision Purchased Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone to replace an under preforming mobile. Have been using this phone for the last one month.It is lovely in appearance. Has decent storage capacity, quick data retrieval capability, good Battery life. Camera performance is commendable.I recommend Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone for those who are looking for a good mobile phone with decent performance. First time i am faced the problem online purchase, after 10 Days mobile display nit working, the acko insurance party not collecting, he told go to service center and  repair it we can reimbursing the invoice amount, but when i am going to add bank details these is A difficulty in IFSC Code. Till today my mobile not ready and not possible to online Update, - Phone becomes hot on using for 10 minutes- Poor battery performance, in around 8-10 minutes 1% of battery is consumed while browsing some app (no music or videos were played)- Phone is thick and heavy to hold and it brings pain in fingers and hand (this cannot be blamed as weight is already mentioned in case description)- Never expected such product from Samsung Having trouble with network connection for mobile data access & hotspot also.User interface also not user-friendly. Heavy to handle for prolonged usege.Call recorder toggle switch also not found during call screen buttons.Not even gestures available for emergency torch light on & off. Only available in notification switch panel.Connection issue faced while browsing, YouTube thumbnail not showing, Facebook buffering to play video & scrolling got struck repeatedly and even browser app update also could not complete even after several attempts in playstore.Battery backup performance was also not satisfied even when 6000MAH capacity configuration with 6GB RAM / 128GB STORAGE available.Very embarrassing experience with this new Samsung Galaxy M12 after 3 years smooth usage with my present device(redmi y2). Mobile have a decent look,For this money range we should not expect high,It will flexible to our parents for youth, you should think twice,Battery life was good, Fingerprint was perfect,Face unlock when light was sufficient it works good,In low light bit late but works.Main drawback was weight of mobile it was bit heavy.Front Camera have decent image in daylight, but we will observe Noise in Image.Something with back Camera.This review is purely my experience with M12 mobile. After usage of 6 months, I\\'m satisfied with the smartphone. In this budget, this is possibly one of the best offerings. In the world of Android,nowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price range.Camera is OK enough. At least OK for a 10k phone.Sound quality is loud and clear, with display of good quality. Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyable.Interface is clean and multitasking is smooth. Charging is fast enough. Obviously, the best part is it\\'s massive battery and power usage. With moderate use, it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the go.In the 10-11k category, this is possibly the best I\\'ve used so far. This is a phone for ages to keep.Thanks to Amazon, delivery was in perfect condition.P.S. Before buying, even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews. I\\'m a common user, and my understanding is if you\\'re expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone, then your expectations are to be blamed. Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored ones.If you want top of the line, you gotta spend top of the line.This phone gets the BASICS right, and that is what matters in the long run. And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera; even if they do,they will compromise in some other areas. Whereas, M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner. Overall, if you want Smooth operations with Reliability, trust Samsung M12. Battery life is so good  and camera quality  is average  like 13 mp. Front camera is like 2 mp. Fingerprint reader working without touch finger. When we hold in hand then finger  print reader trust to read any part of hand so it was problem. Processing system is very low. And in this mobile internet speed very slow. And in low network  it\\'s  internet  not worked. Only show processing. It\\'s budget phn with all facilities plus Samsung brand... It\\'s a good choice... You can buy it without doubt if you want a good battery life,  good picture quality,  good camera, also its not lagging in game, good processor and ram with no overheating issue... In this budget it\\'s the best budget and pocket friendly phone. You can\\'t expect more in this budget i bought this phone from amazon with in 6 months of my purchase , one day it just got heated up in my hand and went blank i went to samsung auth repairs and i was told that its mother board has corrupted and needs to get changed but it is not covered in warranty then what the warrenty is for they asked 9000 to repair it so i have no choice but leave it that way lost 110000 rs will never buy samsung product ever The phone works rather smoothly has a decent battery life where it lasts the entire day with the charge being at 47% by midnight. The camera performs well for the price, except the camera quality in the dark is grainy, and could be better. There is a weight to it which adds to the build of the phone. There is one speaker grill on the right side of the phone and has excellent audio. Would recommend 10/10 Except a single band Wifi rest all is fine. I see the product description doesn\\'t say much about its wifi band support. It should have said that it supports only 2.4ghz band.I have no complaints about the others stuffs except that samsung should not bloat the software bundle with so many non essential packages that I can\\'t uninstall. Dear all. I am writing this review very honestly, may other user get benefitted from this.I used this for 3 weeks and I would say it is clearly waste of your hard earn money .Pro.  Only batteryCons. 1.Heavy  and bulky2. Not adjustable in single hand for selfie4. Camera front. Worst quality all time grainy pic, no beautification5. Back camera also produce worst quality6. Processor is not much for heavy user7. Many time screen lag and hangDear it would be batter you purchase resume, dalne or opportunity in this price segment.If you use zoom app then go for snapdragon process over 700 it will be you option of virtual background in mobile . Media tek processor will not do much.I wnna to back this phone but window close by amazon and I purchased it\\'s glass and guard and covers. So no option left. Pl don\\'t buy this phone. Samsung create waste product in camera  In. This phone. I am big samsung fan but nowadays samsung making the phones which are not capable for compete with other phones in this price range and mid range. WIFI 5 is not here , they can give only amoled screen , nowadays amoled is normal. Camera is not good but it\\'s ok for this price range. Only battery life is good. Giving preloaded apps which are uninstallable. Buy in your own choice if you can add 1-1.5k more then go for other company phones coz nowadays these samsung phones getting hang problem  6 months later, I had m20 which had the same problem Fingerprint reader is really good and quickBattery life is good tooCamera quality is decent, since I m not much into photography I am goodProcessor isn\\'t powerful enough to run heavy games , but it don\\'t play heavy games, so this mobile is perfect for meAbsence of secure folder is kinda heartbreaking but nothing that we can\\'t manage Had a mix up Galaxy M21 with M12 . Both comes next to next when you search for M21 . The price of the 6 GB varient of m12 and 4 GB of m21 is also the same . Only problem is M21 is Super amoled , Full HD with latest processor .  No comparison with both . Realized this only on unboxing when the screen looked very ordinary on running the phone .The lag to move from one function to the next is glaring ( even when it is brand new ). Reported this to amazon . They could not help as the seller support page is just a computer generated one which just runs you in circles . Basically no way to contact seller. Only a postal address - in todays world how is it even going to work?  Tried seller website .No reply . I was more than willing to Pay more since it was partly my mistake . Feel cheated with price of a decent phone which starts off slower than my 4 yr old current phone . If only the seller could help . Samsung Galaxy M12 can be a good choice for customers who are looking for a Samsung smartphone under Rs 15,000. The smartphone offers a quad-rear camera, HD+ display and is backed by a 6000mAh battery which can easily last for two days. Camera quality is real good.  Fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive sound quality is betterHowever the phone is on the heavier side ,Does not comes with the clear case and headphones and you might want to add a good screen guard and case .Thank you Been using this device as a secondary phone for my office purpose. Camera is not good, comes with bloatware every time there is an security update the bloatware apps are reinstalled again, have to delete them again and again.Performance is disappointing, the phone is slow.Display is Ok but there is a noticeable light leak from below panel visible on screen.Device is very heavy, thick and long in length making it hard to use with single hand.I am using it as secondary device, I only use for office apps like MS Teams, Outlook with office admin portal app which gives my company complete root access to device so I am using it only for office communication purpose and I am glad it’s not my primary device.Save your money go for other device not this one. I would not even recommend this to gift to elderly as this is heavy thick and slow phone. Fingerprint sensor often doesn\\'t respond. Without any reason phone goes in deep sleep mode and go for 3-5 cycle of restarting automatically then start working. Updates are available but not getting installed properly.Called service centers several times but no response received. It appears a faulty product.Camera appears good but if you compare the quality of pic with other models of Samsung it\\'s quality is very average. 👂Do not waist your money on this mobile..👍Mobile is good as secondary usage, non slippery surface is the only good thing.👍You can change video quality in apps like u-tube, Amazon prime etc.👎Worst display👎Camera, display and touch quality not good👎Heavy weight 220gmNote✍️Go for another mobile with latest configuration. Used for about a month.Battery: and fast charge is good to have. Battery really lasts. But phone is very heavy due to that. Lenth of phone is long too so has a chance to fall if the pocket isn\\'t deep enough.Takes a good 2:30 hours to charge.Key pad is sensitive and great.Touch lock/fingerprint senser isn\\'t upto the mark. I have used honor 7x and their sensor is far better.Screen size is impressive.Camera is good. This phone does it job, but don\\'t fall for 90Hz,It\\'s gimmick, higher refreshing screen are only good if phone works smooth. This Amazon app don\\'t even work properly, while scrolling these apps stutter,And junk! It automatically downloads unnecessary apps and makes phone even slower.Please go by other smart phone in this range.And if you are reading this review in 2021, please never consider phones below 20k for this brand. Go but mi, moto, realme, OPPO, vivo, you will get what you want. This mobile has got excellent battery backup it\\'s a beast.The display is also best 👍.The camera is ok-ok quality i.e Average quality as if u zoom a little the pixel decreases.The face regonization is very bad it doesn\\'t work at all, you have to move ur face to 1-2 cm distance from Phone than only it works.No complain regarding fingerprint, it\\'s works smoothly 😌.The sound through the speakers are quality sounds 👌.Overall except the face regonization this mobile is perfect👍.I gifted this mobile to my maa and she is happy with it 😊. Mobile at cost of  only ₹9999 is perfect for me 👌. I have used this for a week now.So here is the detailed reviewPros1. Good battery life3. Fast processing4. Nice sound5. Good fingerprint  scannersCons :1. Average display(video quality sucks)2. Big on hand3. Screen is very soft it will break in a 2-3 fall4.Average camera.Go for m21 2021 edition for better camera.M12 quad can camera is if no use Good Phone in this price segment and overall decent performance but camera is not really good as samsung showcase its true 48 megapixel ,even front camera quality not so good.Battery wise thumbs up!Charging time about 2- 2:30 hrs. 0-100, it will give you 1 day battery backup even after heavy usage.Dual 4G volte with dual standby.Screen quality preety good.It an heavy phone.For business purpose I recommend this phone.Overall 8/10. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Dear Amazon Customer service,Am Shailendra an Prime member of Amazon.I purchased an Samsung Mobile phone M12 from Amazon portal.but received an faulty phone,where unable to hear voice in calls.requested Amazon to replace.they called me and undergoes an test of Mobile,finds the fault and ordered replacement on 9th of this month.Till none of technician/ delivery/ pickup agent cane to me to replace.Am herewith attaching screenshot for your reference.Requesting Amazon Technical/ customer service team to sort out my issue at earliest. The honest review could have been 2.5* considering, performance & camera quality, yet I\\'m giving it 5* because : when i was about to buy this phone i was on a budget and this was the best option for me, a 6/128 model of a top brand at 13500RS was a good deal and my top priority always was battery back and this amused me with its battery back up. If you are looking for a phone with strong battery back up with limited budget? Go for it... Otherwise you\\'ll disappointed. For my use case, a single charge lasts me around 6 days (charge 100% to 40%, after which I recharge again). Actually it should last me more than 10 days I think, if I allow it to drop to 1% before recharging. My use case is: office related video calls, email, WhatsApp, online shopping, connecting to chrome cast and watching YouTube videos on tv, sms, phone calls, reading kindle books, etc. Screen ON time, about an hour or so a day depending on video call duration. I do not play games on my phone. I keep it on battery saving mode, and 60hz screen refresh.Been using the phone for more than a month now. Very satisfied with the performance. Only slight issue was the slightly heavier weight of the phone compared to my previous phone. But I have gotten used to it and it does not bother me at all now.Regarding the screen being non fullHD, I thought it would be something I would notice. Nope, I feel no difference when reading books on kindle. Maybe teenagers with better eyesight will notice, but I definitely cannot.In summary, I’m very happy with the purchase. I just hope Samsung keeps pushing the updates till at least android 13, and security updates for at least 4 years. That would be perfect. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Phone is good at this price. Battery life is long. It will lasts upto 2 days if you are doing simple tasks on it.Processor is good.But one thing here is to mention that, if you are looking for good camera quality phone this is not it. Its front camera is not good. Picture quality ruining when you zoom in. So Overall good phone 🖖 except camera 📷 First of the phone was a worth purchaseand best budget promise by samsung.For a normal user epecially for middle aged one\\'s and new android experiencing one\\'s it is a better choise, why because of the branded non chinese mobile.Perfomance :1.Camera quality : primary camera is best and give awesome clicks but not impressed in secondary, but i repeat its a budget based handset by samsung..2.Finger print reader: take a few seconds some times, but in a wide range it is fast.3.Battery life : its awesome no word to say...And fast charging 15wA negative portion is weight, its weight is about 221 gm it\\'s heavier i noted this here because, samsung introduced m21 model with more specifications and perfomance carrying the same monster typical battery 6000 mah but weighing only around188gm is very lite weight and easy to handle (remember the prize difference).Overall my conclusion is the product is worth for money. I am completely satisfied, why because i had that much money....So no over expectations, thank you samsung.And especially thankyou Amazon for best service again. I bought this phone to last 5years(thus OPPO or Vivo was not an option).........my first phone was Samsung metro.......now it\\'s Samsung galaxy m12..........user interface is good.......the phone barely looses any charge when idle or used via wired earphones..........satisfied till now Giving 3 stars because1 - It only have got 2.4 ghz wifi card, 5 ghz wifi will not work on this. So if you have modern day fiber internet wifi, chances are it won\\'t probably be compatible with this device.2 - It says 48MP camara but it is not the best camara regarding the specs. I don\\'t understand why it got 4 camaras when other 3 are barley average in terms of quality.If you can have few extra thousands, then go with m30s series.I understand Samsung has to do stuff to do cost cutting and marketing, I also own a m31, that one is better. Also random apps will download from samsung app store until you dont force stop samsung app store. Good battery back up.Sound and picture could have been better at this price.Unable to make credit card payments through this phone, states version should be above 18.3.My prior phone was doing it bought 4 years ago.Within weeks timePhone at this cost hasLow camera qualityHanging issues unfortunateTechnician checked and advised for replacement. Agreed with issues.Don\\'t see options to return, please stay away folks. I have faced at least 2 bugs while using this phone in whatsapp,1. after capturing image send button was not available on the screen2. I was not able to send messages to anyone while my other apps were working fine which uses internet connectionsamsung and whatsapp developer please look into thiscamera quality is average or near to poor Beyond expectations, an affordable phone in this budget with great features loaded. This phone has the latest android 11 with a great camera, very good battery life, Exynos processor, IPS display with 90Hz, and is well built. This phone is easy to use for gaming and has a lot of memory to store all your media files and documents. Timely delivered and thanks to Amazon for such fast delivery. heavyweight mobile. camera not good. only brand name none other than.  other brand like infinix, Asus are too good to use.  good looking but not so special. dont go for famous brands. please use and welcome new brands and functions. if you are really know how to use mobiles then use under 15 k rupees. dont waste a lot of money on costly mobiles. I just bought a brick!The phone is too heavy as brickSlow as snail.Camera quality is worstInterface seems oldPrice : avg.Amazon return policy won\\'t allow you to return that is biggest disadvantage.I insist potential buyers to avoid going for such tempting offers on this device n go for MI /Realme for way better features n feel in this price segment. What benefit we will get if I have 6gb or 8gb ram. How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi, means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature. Very much disappointed with this big drawback. Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12. Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description. Seems like Im using 10 years back mobile. Its super heavy. Resolution is no good and I have eye pain. Camera is very bad. Yes they have given 6000 mah battery but it takes more than 2 hours to charge fully. And battery does not work like a 6k mah battery.Does not expect this from Samsung as they have huge market nowadays compare to Apple worldwide. The phone is great. Good display and UI. Comes with 6000 maH huge battery. Charging is quick but 1 thing that comes as negative is the camera. The camera doesn\\'t seem like 48 MP. It struggles in low light & the Front camera also suffers the same problem. You can certainly go for it if you are OK with below standard camera. Amazon delivery was excellent The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It is best at this cost from a brand like samsung. Display resolution is HD but it\\'s 90 Hz. Battery life is awesome lasts 2 days. Camera is disappointing though. There isn\\'t any gcam available yet. No silicon case in box. One UI is the best UI I have ever used yet. Fast updates. 15 Watt charger included takes almost 2 hrs for full charge which lasts for almost 2 days As far as my opinion is concerned, the over all features are Ok. The drawback features are:1. M12 is out of Super Amolrd Screen.2. Back Fingerprint is more covenient than side3. Camera quality is not so hifi than other models4. S Bike mode should given, which will be helpful ehile driving..5. Charger model is different  than other M series Mobiles with battery of 6000 mah. Purchased in June.What I like-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user  it\\'s a big thumbs up.- Storage capacity- Navigation speed- Not made in ChinaWhat I dislike- It\\'s quite heavy!- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have  used so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I  don\\'t know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of  Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn\\'t buy this phone  for cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are  even lower than what I expected.- Screen resolution.If you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far. I baught this phone but after 2-3days use i fill like its Display having some flickering issue then I Raised a Complaint. Then a Technician visited my phone and told me everything is fine. Them after 4-5 days later I again Feel Like Choppy And lagging problm and The Flickering issue. Then I called customer service they told me its out of replacement Policy. But when I insisted them they agreed to replace It. Now I am satisfied With the phone.Phone is smooth ( Just go in developer options and Set the animation scale to 0.5x Them Everything will be smooth)Battery is Monstar (6000MAH)Display have TFT panel But Samsung is Alasy winner in display department.Te display shows Deep Black not as Samoled panel but Better then (MI,Realme,oppo,vivo)Phone is Heavy but manageable.Cameras Are Decent enough For te Price range.I bought it for 8550/-I am happy 😊 with the device now.Now lets see What happen.I am writing the review After 15 days.Please check tw device Before buying.Thank You. Got this phone @7749 after Exchange & bank discount at this rate no branded mobile may not come with Android 11..., so far is good still needs to check in all respects but all basic functions are working fine. ProsExcellent Display for the price even if it is LCD (Samsung Expertise)Face ID with Fingerprint sensorOne UI is nice, smooth and feels modernUSB-C chargerLong Battery LifeConsPhone weights too high (more than 200 g)Samsung bloatwares are present and makes continued attemps to trick you for installation.Camera is fairly average, should have been little improved.No fast charging supportOverall good budget buy if you are looking for non Chinese budget smartphone. I expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..Pros:-1. Long Battery Life.2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like \"do not disturb while in driving\" etc.,)3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.Cons:-1. Total Weight of Mobile.2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.3. Display quality is also not good.4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..If anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that\\'s why I recommended this brand). 👍 I liked the phone battery last long even I tool 6GB ram version but the phone is little sluggish in performance may be the chipset is not great in performing daily task. But one UI is great even 120 he refresh rate I found phone performance not upto my expectations while comparing to my old redmi phone but I liked that unnecessary apps are not getting installed like redmi. Camera is great and battery life is awesome. (Review it after using for a month)It\\'s battery backup is quite impressive, camera is good but could be more simpler interface, I am not a gaming person but as per my Experience it\\'s working smooth, but yes sometimes for a sec you will it might be slow but overall it\\'s a worth Price product as of now. It was very happy when I received it that I haven\\'t spent money on China mobile but within 10 day I started regretting as it has started to hang very frequently and that\\'s annoying. I haven\\'t added extra memory card and using phone with only one SIM. Return policy was 7 days and it started hanging from 9th day :( Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature, GREAT battery life, camera, UI, lives up to its reputation;Great specs all round, only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi “5G wifi”When you buy a phone with such great specs, it’s a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation. Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is 🤮🤮 For this price - Nothing great to be expected.It\\'s a low end phone. So everything about this phone is below average - except battery.Bad ambient light sensor, decent camera, decent amount output, cheap charging cables - bad quality.Excellent battery!Expensive phones - outstanding performanceCheap phones - you get what you pay for Bought it for my mother, its a good phone with monster battery backupPros:Battery 6000 mahAndroid 1190 hertz display8 nm processorRear camera 48mp sony imx sensorDisplayCall quality4 years ota update supportNo lag issueCons:Speaker is not great it gest louder but too shrillProtection cover not included in the box8MP average front cameraPs its a good phone best phone to gift your loved ones Positive point :-1) battery life is massive 🤟2) fingerprint reader is so fast3) best in this price segment4) non scratch poly Carbonated back5)latest Android6) real 48 pixel camera7) Samsung Knox security which is best ever safety from malware virus.Negative point1)if you like camera phone, don\\'t go for it bcoz it doesn\\'t click selfies like oppo,vivo,etc. 😂. It gives real pixel picture.2)a bit heavy phone.Overall this phone is awesome in this segment apart from selfies and heavy weight.Go for it if you need Massive battery back up , a real 48 MP camera. Overall phone is ok. I have 6GB and 128 GB variant.Some advantages are there.1. In this Price getting good phone.2. Till now no heat or not hang.3. Till now Battery backup is good.4.  Video quality is also good.5. Good processor.Some drawback is there.1. Data cable is so small.2.  When charging no notification light is showing. When charge is full you have to check manually.3. Camera is not to the up yo mark like true 48MP.4. No notification light is there for missed call or anything.5. No Return policy is there. I am using this phone from past 3 months and I never played any heavy games in this phone. I use it to attend calls and social media, watching videos,  listening music and for clicking pictures.I\\'m using Vodafone and jio Sim & I\\'m facing issue with Vodafone signal, whenever I\\'ll get call it use to disconnect in-between.Camera performance is not bad, but I\\'m not happy with battery performance.  It has a 6000mAh battery but I have to charge my phone everyday it consume lot of battery.And phone is little heavy you have to buy additional cover and screen protector.Only charger and type c cable is available along Damage product reshived hua hai or koi help nahi ki ja rahi haiअमेजॉन से प्रोडक्ट मंगाया था यह अभी तक 20 का कोई सर्विस नहीं हुआ है कोई नहीं पिकअप भी नहीं आर्डर पेंडिंग में और जो अमाउंट थी वह भी कट गया है 20 दिन हो चुके हैं पूरे I am writing this review after using the device for 10 days.It is very good mobile in this price range. The battery life is awesome, lasts for 3 days once full charged with normal usage. The speed is also good, works well for daily usage. The camera is not the best does not feel like 48 MP. The 6.5\" display is very impressive. Gives amazing video and audio quality.Overall I liked this one and highly recommend to buy it. I have been using Samsung M21, also my 2 family members using same model.So thought to buy this M12 for my father.1. Biggest disappointment DisplayLooks like a old age mobile2. Camera is ok ok3. Only good thing is battery 🔋.4. Cheap plastic body5. Heavyweight6. Go for Samsung M21 it\\'s more better. Camera quality is very poor and display quality too. This model is not listed in the exchange models list also. How funny that Amazon sold a mobile and they aren\\'t considering the same model for exchange what kind of business ethics is this where as the same model is listed on Flipakrt for exchange models. - My contact book is not too large, around 700 contacts, yet it takes a couple of seconds to load it. It didn\\'t happen in my previous mobiles even though they were less powerful than this device.- Although it has 4 cameras at the back, the portrait mode is completely nonsense. My previous phone had only 2 cameras on back yet it\\'s portrait mode was a thousand times better.- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button and a real pain to use when you have a mobile cover. I am writing this review after the usage of 25 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues.  charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up. The main issue I am facing is that the phone battery  is slow charging and quick battery draining.. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. 😡😡 Decent phone at 9,000 (after bank offers). The processor and display are not upto the standard. But given that this phone has knox security, I have little to complain about. This phone is strictly for old people who just needs a secure phone for day to day usage like messaging, calling, etc. Not recommended for any user who wants to do a lot of multitasking or gaming. I buy this phone on Diwali offer for Rs9500 on 30 Oct 2021.For this price the phone is worthy enough..Now it been nearly 20days of usage..Pros..1.Best Battery life even in heavy usage it hold for a day its amazing...2.Rear Camera Shows the real face and color tone without additional filters in that way I love it..3.Display more than enough..90Hz Awesome4.Fastest FingerPrint Reader in this segmentCons...1.Front Camera not too bad as well as not good too..average for selfie lovers..but for me I like this one...Note it Mainly👇👇2.Processor or something make the phone lag...lag in popup the keyboard itself is not good....if it is a bug need fix immediately..3.Asking Updates for all the apps... may be it because of the phone launch day it was March 2021..I\\'m a Samsung fan So for me it is a better option for this rate..if you love Samsung buy it without the second thought...Apart all of the above the best phone for daily moderate users...OK for heavy usage(For Hours)... I bought this for my mother. I ll just list what I don\\'t like.1. Too heavy. Don\\'t buy this for old people2. Camera is shaky and output is not great. I don\\'t know why they have given four cameras.3. Too much of useless Samsung apps and galaxy items interrupting in between. I cannot able to disable these. Samsung is cheating people with marketing big numbers for a product. All the specifications are just on paper.In reality, every specification is just sub-par.Camera quality is same as what you see in phones that released in 2012-2013, like Galaxy Grand 2.Battery is advertised as 6000mAh, but in actual, it gives the same result as a 3000mAh battery.Processor is just utter crap.Seeing a phone for the first where the initial setup itself lags like anything.Display quality feels same as resistive touch era phones.Screen shows bleeding symptoms.I wish they had a return policy instead of replacement. This hand phone is perfect for those who want it for day to day use with decent gaming experience also security wise it is good one, actually before purchasing this phone i had watched so many videos in YouTube and amzon, After using it for some days I think it is very good for an average person but if you want to compare this phone with some other devices i think that you should avoid to buy this mobile phone also, if you have been using some high end devices for some times then also you should think before purchasing this phone. In my personal opinion i think this is very good phone with excellent camera and battery life, also performance wise it is good for day to day use. Itne kam daam mai Samsung ka bharosa aur NonChinese device wo bhi made in India. So go for it I\\'m sure this phone will not disappoint you. Device is Heavy.Camera Quality is very poor.Screen Quality is very poor compare to othwr device in market.Fast charging is OkBattery backup is also Ok.I would recommend try other device in the same segment Like Redmi, Mi, Poco. I had a lot of doubts before purchase on seeing the negative reviews lying here and there but my experience with the Samsung m12 was really exciting. It has good battery backup, the display, even though 720p is not bad to look at, screen brightness is optimum. RAM management is good for day to day apps. Haven\\'t found any lags.  Haven\\'t tried playing any games on it. The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge.  Over all it is a great phone. The true monster. Update: After using it for nearly 6 months I\\'m facing proximity sensor issue, which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which I\\'m planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device. There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube. The battery life is still awesome. Hey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn\\'t so great. The battery life isn\\'t good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn\\'t as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn\\'t accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect! Pros:Great Battery Life. Upto 2 days minimum.Great Camera.Superior smoothness in usability4GB RAM for multitasking.Built and feel of the phone.I use the phone primarily for clicking product photos for my website, and business calls. On a personal level, a powerful battery and camera saves me time and gives me a hassle free experience.  I use all sorts of video and image editing apps that requires a lot of ram usage and the phone has never crashed so far. Also does well for gaming. Hard core gaming may be sluggish. But for the price perspective, this phone is all you ever need.Cons:Face Detection  for unlocking — takes atleast 3 seconds to react. The fingerprint sensor is comparatively faster. But both is a little annoying at times. Please do not buy this phone because Samsung Galaxy M12 phone generating too much heat with this I can not operate the phone in normal condition. I kept the order in return and the authorized technician came and he decided, the is phone working normal but the compliant was too much heat generates when it\\'s in the handset, in this case, how I could not take calls and operate the mobile. there is no return policy and only replacement but that also not happened. I was very much disappointed with amazon\\'s service and I lost 13499/- and my requirement not fulfilled. Very heavy phone. Peculiar problem of Samsung phone always in hung state .if you want to use in outdoor in day time you can\\'t see anything bon screen.  For screen shot you need to put an extra floating menu on screen which is very irritating. No compass app you can run on phone as it lacks the sensors. Friends don\\'t buy it, Chinese phones are far far better than this. I also purchased it just to avoid Chinese phone and now I repaint it. Since sep 21 I am using it and this is worst phone I have ever had.

I was looking for a smartphone for my mother with a price range of 9-11 k and was confused between Resmi 9 series and Samsung M12. I finally decided to go for samsung since it has a good resale value. The battery life is just amazing, since my mom uses the phone for basic functions like calls, watching videos on youtube and social media, the battery lasts easily for 3 days on a full charge Pros:*On the internet, some found the phone heavy a little bit, but for me, it looked like a sturdy mobile*Great Rear camera quality, Good front camera quality*Ultra quick fingerprint sensor*Descent battery life indeed, suggest you use the phone mildly and charge the battery only up to 85-95% for at least 1 week. I use the phone mostly for YouTube and social media and with that using its battery last for about 2.5 - 3 days or sometimes 3.5 days as wellCons:*Face Recognition is slow, but you won\\'t need that if you use fingerprint*Not meant for high-end gaming cause sometimes frame dropsBtw purchased the phone for Rs 9499 Not up to the mark too many cons1)phone ram management is not good it hangs too much 90hz screen is only for show whenever u set screen at 90hz its start hamging2) VGA camera is better than this 48megapixal camera3)when i start mobile and setup it hang and restart more than 2 time so i will suggest  dongo for this phone I bought this smartphone for my mother as I knew there would be no large applications used, so the phone would not need much processing. But this phone started to freeze and lag even when applications of size 10 -15 MB were installed. I have been a loyal Samsung customer for nearly 10 years, but now it\\'s time to move on I think.I will not suggest this phone to anyone. You can get far better phones at this same cost. Fingerprint reader ,battery life and camera are 👍good as compare to others within this budget. My decision was very clear before purchasing that I would buy only phone within ₹13000 so I purchased and in my opinion  if ones budget is same then go ahead don\\'t thing and read negative  review The fingerprint reader is placed at an ideal location and works without fail. The battery life is really good even though it takes a long time to charge so in all good. camera quality of the primary camera is good for everyday use. The design of the phone is such that it does not wobble and there are no protruding camera. The built quality feels solid. No fingerprint smudges.I have experienced some jitters but nothing to complain about. Calling over WiFi facility works very good and the earpiece quality is decent. No issues with proximity sensor. Though it lacks the bells and whistles of its competitors, it does well. There is nothing extraordinary to write about, but it is actually good as there are nothing extremely negative to write about. Buy it and it will work as its supposed to. Also trusting on Samsung brand name for data privacy. Great budget smartphone from Samsung.Got a bit worried after reading all the negative reviews about the phone\\'s display and camera but they didn\\'t fail me or Samsung. Great battery life and display looks awesome. Camera is normal; neither extremely extraordinary nor disappointing. Overall camera is satisfactory at this price. RAM and Processor give very smooth performance. Don\\'t get worry about the bullshit negative reviews (by people who want gold at the price of brass).  Go for it. I have gone through many reviews for this phone. But, I\\'ve not seen anyone talking about sound quality. Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine.. Maybe my particular handset is troublesome. Anyways, since I got the phone on my hand, I couldn\\'t explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark. I purchased Samsung\\'s phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim.I am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I\\'ve gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years.I got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse.. The sound was pretty loud be it media sound, ringtones, call sound, etc.Frankly speaking, I\\'ve not checked gaming, camera and other features the way I did with sound quality. I\\'d recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible. Good phone for the price. The responsiveness of the screen to touch is a little wanting. Battery not as good as expected, lasts for about a day and a half with moderate usage.  Camera is great but it\\'s a pain to select and toggle through the settings. Really have to look hard to realise it is a high resolution image. My other purchase is an M12 which feels really premium compared to this phone. The price difference at time of purchase was only 2k. Firstly amazon cc is very inefficient in handling my queries, series of wrong communication from chat support, phone support. My email is not yet answered since 8 days. Now, samsung m12 phone - out of 64gb only 50-52gb is available and remaining 12-13gb occupied by system. Out of 4gb ram 1.8gb approx is occupied by system. Camera quality is very very poor. Phone hangs too much like if i unlock the phone it takes more than 10-15 sec to display clock, navigation icons, notifications panel etc. Phone heats up if we use gdrive, maps, hotspot. Screen and body is very delicate. Plz think much before you go for this. An upset frustrated Amazon cusromer, Sameer! Its a budgeted phone. 6 GB/ 128 GB storage variant is good. Battery backup is awesome. Took 3-3.5 hrs to full charge. Not happy with front camera quality & Awful at night. NO slow motion capturing feature. Rear camera is better in daylight & good at night. Not happy with side touch sensor. Took so many attempts sometimes to unlock. But, overall I am happy using it because navigation sensor, battery backup & performance of phone is good compared with other brands. Great product for the money. Thankfully it\\'s not Chinese and there\\'s peace of mind when using banking apps or other apps which warrants security of non Chinese servers. The camera to screen everything is as good it can get for the money and software is way above what the Chinese offers. After use of one month i can say,Excellent battery life, sound quality is good, Its not easy to handle due to its heavyness but it can be bcos of 6000mah battery. Fingerprint sensor is good. Camera quality is not good as expected from 48 mega pixels. Front camera is not good at all. But overall experience till now is very Good. Want to give 5star but one star less due to its camera and Handling. Samsung camera is supposed to be far better than Lyf Wind, regretably it is on par. You could sell this lower end of the product range for may be 7000 or max 7500. Beats many local brands yet not satisfactory. Giving a 4 starFeed back: Sold my old Wind Lyf phone for Rs 1350 to a small dealer. Rs 450 exchange value is not fair at all. like you I have searched the reviews for this mobile..just keep this two things in your mind while you choose to buy this mobile.1. If you are a low range mobile user and u trying to buy high range mobile then this is the perfect mobile with exotic features and to perfect price like 10500.2. If you are a high range user mobile price of above 15000 then this will be little low campares to that m12 but m12 gives it own best Performances.You can\\'t  compare this mobile 10500rps  to the mobiles above 15000 because  if you put plus money then it comes with  more features  that\\'s the difference..so you must compare the features with price tags then scroll to the reviews  for performance of the mobile  like you and me! Conclusion:-  Review is only for this mobile so...this kind a features with this price is absolutely  worth it. Performance  was damn good of every features and last Final finger print sensor is a exotic feature in this mobile the it works is like DAMN GIRL!Thank you. I have just picked it up in budget category for day to day needs, well I\\'m not disappointed with my choice it\\'s a great package to offer at this price point keeping my needs in mind.However the phone is very sluggish in response, if you\\'re looking for performance from this phone kindly stay away it will disappoint you.Hope my review helps prospective buyers. After using since 5 days......1. 90Hz display really smooth2. Camera quality little better if you select 48M camera setting . Not really good one for photography.3.battery backup is too good, as I am not a gamer4. Too heavy to carry ...After using with back cover it feels almost 500 GM to me5. Voice clarity is really good.6. 4G speed is awesome.7. Overaally it\\'s a nice phone ...... Bought this phone a week ago.Budget Phone for people who need a good smart phone at lower rate with good battery backup of 6000mah.Phone is not very heavy, screen is bigger which is good for watching movies/videos.Negative: keypad is not showing fully when using upi mobile app.Otherwise phone is good.Will write more reviews after using it for some more time This product is fantastic for this price! I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user, it can easily last you and day or a day and a half. And for a light user, it can last you 2 - 3 days! Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it\\'s not pixely, but it\\'s not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly. I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better. 1) Look and feel of the mobile is good but little heavier due to 6000 mAH battery.2) Camera quality is good but slow - takes more time to save the picture.3) Fingerprint reader is good.4) Overall performance is slower.5) Battery support - 2 days under normal use. It got deliver on 14th April. After using few days I find my moto phone was better in features. I am not able to take screenshot using power button + vol down button. It always show Power off + restart + emergency.Motion and guestures features are limited compare to moto. No option for 3 finger touch screen shot or palm slide screenshot. Rest is ok. Not much imprressed. I ordered it on 2nd of may and got it on 5th of may. I am pretty much with which which the phone comes. This phone has really exceeded a lot of expectations regarding the features that its loaded with. But the only thing with which  I am disappointed with is its size🤔, its quiet \"fat\"😅to say. But really.... I am astonished with its battery backup. It\\'s a huge for phones in this price range. It comes with 6000mah battery which I felt, a #monster precisely😳. The camera....OMG!!!!!its just too good. It comes with 84mp quad camera . It has a 10x zoom, which is super clear. The fingerprint reader is mounted on the side,down the volume button. It\\'s too awesome. It  senses the print, even on a thin plastic sheet is placed on it. Other than all this , to say, it a great budget friendly and a must buy on the other hand. It should be in one\\'s list , if he/she is looking for the #monster in 10k bracket💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 1. To begin with battery life is pretty good, however it takes little longer to fully charge the phone.2. Front came is pathetic. Rear camera is some how ok for basic usage.3. Fingerprint will work whenever it wants to (not everytime you need it) so remember phone pinlock to be on a safer side.4. Phone got hanged twice within 15 days of normal usage.5. Overall this is a phone for elderly person or for someone who is low to minimal user on a daily basis. Bought this new phone for my mom on 5th Oct.. the day I recieved the phone I had issue with camera quality (checked and confirmed by Amazon technician as well) also faced issue with dialler tone while making call.. there was no sound of the dialler tone.. Amazon replaced and sent me a new phone on the 9th Oct.The new phone had no issue with Camera but issue with dialler tone was still there. I raised the issue with Amazon and they provided me an appropriate solution with amazing service and initiated the refund.I don\\'t think Samsung phones are worth buying at the price range of below 10k.I might prefer going for Realme, MI, Vivo or any other brand over Samsung. I bought this phone for my mother as a secondary phone.Gamingbwas our of question, needed good battery life and goo calling support.Pros -Battery Life is amazing, the phone never heats up. No matter what.It\\'s a sub par processor. But does the normal job. Don\\'t play or install any games on this. Use it for calls, media.One UI is clean. But make sure to delete all the junk apps and disable swing seevices.90Hz is actually visibleCamera bump is non existentThere is WiFi calling, unlime a lot of people suggest.ConsHeavy and thick phone.Stutters when you give it some intense job.No 5GHz WiFiColours aren\\'t the best at this price. Display could have been much better. But won\\'t notice Unless you compare it side by side.For 10k it\\'s a good buy for a light user.If you\\'re a heavy user. Go for Poco M3 or Redmi Note 10 or Micromax In1 if ur budget is 10k. I am writing review after using almost 1month of using this phone, so please take serious before buying this. There is no return policy only replacement available. So think twice.Please dont fall in offer, worst phone ever, always ask for software update.Heavy in weight.Camera Quality poor.Battery life poor.Sound Quality poor.Don\\'t fall in rat race. I am reviewing this after 2 months of usage! It was good ! It is little heavy compared to other samsung mobile! The battery life is good... But not as worth for 6000mah! I don\\'t play games i just use social media! For social media useage its bit Oke! And the camera! Seriously! 48mp is not that good its Oke! Just oke!! But its totally budget friendly! For its cost, I believe the phone is worth it. Till now, it hasn\\'t shown any problems. Everything works fine. Battery is magnificent. Only problem is the fingerprint sensor. It is on the side on top of the power button. So, the space is very small. Most of the back covers or flip covers cover this fingerprint sensor partially and the device does not unlock. The ear piece speaker is not working from day one . I had gifted the phone to a senior citizens. He was using the phone on speaker mode. He did not tell me about it until I found him using speaker to talk. By the time I came to know about the issue 7 days had past. Now no return option available. And I went to samsung authorised service centre there they don\\'t have spares to rectify the problem. So still we are using the phone with speaker on. Did not expect such a quality from a big brand like samsung. Feeling very disappointed. All over best phone to buy at this price range.Pros-*UI is too easy to operate very fast based on android one.*Battery 🔋 is too good giving back-up upto 10 hrs of heavy duty.*Charger is 15w slidely charging fast.*Display is very power efficient & size is good.*No heating issue.*Security review is good*Processor Speed is likely good.*Fingerprint sensor is very fast & side mountedCons-*Camera features are not given like pro mode, slow-motion, fast motion.*Photo quality need to be more advanced.*Device is little bit thik causing of the powerful 6000 mah battery.*Display is not so bright also not so dark & colour are not displaying as expected.*Expected amoled display as Samsung always given in the past.*Speaker sounds like good but volume is not so loud*Weight is little bit heavy. I got the product delivered super-fastt in just 3 days.. I got my Asus Max Pro M1 exchanged  and I must say it was a terrific  experience . Amazon  gave close to Rs.4500 of my 3 year old phone. However,  I must mention that my old phone had no cracks or dents, so that did not diminish its value and was in a good working condition. Battery life is the best part of this phone, it easily lasts for 2 days with moderate usage and 1 full day if you are a gamer or a heavy user. It takes close to 2½ hrs to charge fully. Coming to the cons, the camera is just average and you will be disappointed if you  buy the phone for the camera. The 90hz is smooth. Overall,  I would give this phone a 9/10. Speaker output is low. You will notice this if you consume media using phone\\'s speakerIt has a bug in touch screen out of the box. Gets fixed with first update.It doesn\\'t have proximity sensorBattery life is the biggest positive. On normal usage I get around 2 days battery life with around 11 hours screen time Good 🎤🎤🎤🎤😍🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😍😍🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😍🎤😍😍🎤🎤🎤🎤😍🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😍🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😍🎤🎤🎤🎤😍😍😍😍🎤🎤🎤😍😍😍😍😍🎤🎤🎤😍😍😍😍😍🎤🎤🎤🎤😍😍😍🎤🎤🎤🎤☁🏃☁☁☁🎁☁☁☁🍄🍄🍄☁☁☁🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄☁🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄☁☁🍦🍦🍦☁☁☁☁🍦🍦🍦☁☁🐢☁🍦🍦🍦☁🚩\\ufeff✨🌾  🌾  🌾  😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏🕓🕓😏🕓🕓😏😏🕓🎱😏🕓🎱😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏✔😏😏😏🌀😏😏😏😏😏🌀😏🌀😏😏😏🌀😏👍👉🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🕐🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🕐🕐🕐🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀  🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀  👟  👟☁☁🎈🎈☁☁☁☁😊😊👀😊🌛☁☁☁😊😊😊😊☁☁☁☁☁☁😊😊☁☁☁☁☁☁😊😊☁☁☁☁☁☁😊😊☁☁☁☁☁☁😊😊☁☁☁☁☁☁😊😊☁☁☁🎈☁☁😊😊😊😊😊😊☁☁😊😊😊😊😊😊☁☁😊☁😊☁😊😊🌾🌾😊🌾😊🌾😊😊🏠🔥❗🚒🚒💨🚑💨 Built quality GoodBattery 🔋is Super GoodCamera you can expect more than this from a phone costs 10kPhone is lagging too much of you have more than 15 apps.Very slow performance.I am not a gamer also I don\\'t play any single game. But still the device runs slow. Samsung’s M12 of a 90Hz screen is a budget phone. the giant 6,000mAh battery and clean UI make up for it to some extent, making the Galaxy M12 a decent buy.The Galaxy M12 feels rigid and offers a firm construction. There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power button.good to see Samsung using a USB Type-C port for its affordable devices, and that is present at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and speaker grille. he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 6.5-inch HD+ (720 x 1,600) TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. In its price range, the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate. the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness, controlled saturation levels, and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle. A quad-camera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a massive 123-degree field of view, a 2MP depth, and a 2MP macro sensor. As far as budget phones go, the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details  At night, the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots. I keep my expectations about low-light photography in check from a lot of budget phones, but the M12 is above average and good. Lastly, you get a beefy 6,000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage. after using the phone almost 4 months1. phone is not super fast what company is claiming infact it is slow sometimes.2. If fully charged battery stays 24 to 30 hours even after heavy use but problem is with the time taken for the battery charging is toooo long. so people having busy schedule will always face low in battery, and searching for where to charge 🤔. 15 amp charger kaun deta hain re Samsung?3. M series has bad reputation for software essue but I Did not faced yet except Bluetooth sometimes turned off automatically while listening music.Overall price has dropped 1000 Rs now. I bought it at 10500 Rs. You can buy it, sexy looks. works well. Honestly the phone deserves a rating of 4.5 (deduction 0.5 due to certain minuses of missings like absence of dual band etc)...Overall, the phone feels extremely premium to use with high refresh rate, reasonably fast & zappy processor, good primary camera etc.Another major factor to consider is that the phone is extremely well built & the weight is very evenly distributed.... For price  5/5For battery life  4.5/5For performance  4/5For storage  4.5/5For Camera  4/5But for Sound  3/5Now u know it\\'s good phone in this budgetI bought this in 10,000 /-Apart from sound range... it\\'s well to do phone It does not come with back cover, screen guard, sim slot pin.Charger wire is very small.Display is averageOppo & Vivo displays are far better comparativelySoftware is bit laggy and not so ease of use.Software features are not great Battery is goodBlazing fastDon\\'t read Amazon reviews ,at this price point this is the best fast Samsung phone you will get.Camera is very good for normal use.48 MPMacro mode is very goodCamera usage in low light is great.8nm processor is power efficientThe new Samsung software is fast. User friendly .some people\\'s are saying about UPI PIN entering issues.but I found it not a big issue. A small part of number is not seen. But still we can type. It\\'s not an issue.Overall the phone is awesome. Face recognition is slow. otherwise the phone is super awesome. My 4 months old iPhone se 2020 ran into some hardware issues, due to pandemic I couldn\\'t service it. So I brought this m12 phone, just to be in budget for obvious reason. This phone is under 9999 and if your expecting performance similar to a 40k, then your review needs a think over. This phone exactly does or does more than what it\\'s priced. If you are low budget and want more out of it with some limitations, go for it. Camera  :  Not Good (not up to mark  48 mp)Battery  :  GoodDisplay  :  Not good (like local )Charger with phoneNo back cover with phoneNo ear phone with phoneMany  problem  with phone  you  can say poor quality  of  product o r  below average Mon youtube and  others  they  are  making foolish  about  phone review VIDEO CAN NOT TO BE SENT TO WHATS APP, EVEN 5/6 MINUTES OF VIDEO, ONLY ONE STILL PHOTO & OBLY 10 MINUTES VIDEO IN GALLARY SHOWING THAT THE STORAGE IS FULL ALSO SYSTEM IS NOT SUPPORTING TO SHOOT ANY VIDEO OR TAKE ANY PHOTO. SINE THE DAY WE HAVE  ACTIVATED PHONE ON 15TH dEC BY AIRTEL SIM, VERY RARELY USING PHONE AS VIDEO SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AS PER OUR REQUIRMENTS. SO PLZ SUGGEST BEST SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM AS I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR VIDEO UPLOADING PURPOSE. Such a modern phone but doesn\\'t recognize 5G bandwidth of wifi. Fingerprint reader on lock button is in a very wrongfully place. Phone locks and unlocks because of it. So now have to register a different finger for unlocking and use different finger for locking the phone. If you are looking mobile at this rate ....the best choice is this m12....really loved its features..prons:1)battery life 6000mah it would come for 1 1/2 day with average use2)display was really amazing really loved this huge display..colour,sound was simple good3)camera are nice i took some good shots from them4)it comes with nice os operator +andriod 11.0 v is good in it..5)Soft touch and fringer print and face detection sensor also works well.cons:1)The processor can be better...this processor is good for average usage and average graphics games2)The weight is some what more....finally good phone for this cost compared to all other phone at this range... I read reviews about the battery life and camera and went for this phone. Its good on all aspects except the speaker volume. Even the call ringtone is low on volume. If you work in noisy environment then this phone won\\'t suit you. Even listening to songs on speaker is low on volume. This is a compromise you have to make. Using Samsung smartphone after many years. But have to admit samsung smartphones improved a lot as compared to TouchWiz days. Performance, camera are very good on this device. Battery life excellent. All features functions as intended to be. No bugs in software. User experience is really great. Delighted with this purchase. I would say seller needs to do work with packaging 📦 and. phone delivered to me in good condition but over all its goodAbout phone it is a mid range phone if you are avrage phone user so it is good choice for you 1.Camera is ok 2.Phone performance is ok according to this price 3.Build quality is ok its fully plastic material 4.about display do not expact supper hd displays its ok not so good not so badMy opinion if are buying this for kid, mom , dad ,go for it First what I like1. Great battery backup. I charge the phone on morning and just need to realx. It goes whole day without need to recharge.2. Good camera phone in the price range. Fair3. Good for games that I play. But yes, not the best gaming experience.What I didn\\'t like:1. Hang sometimes. Defective mobile Amazon sellingCopy mobile Amazon giving please don’t buy.I bought 2 phone in offer price but both mobile is worst copy.,after complaint not response fromAmazon bad bad experience., Bad bad bad mobile is not good.copy product sending my money waste 2 mobile I bought but both mobile have battery charging problem 4 hours taking for charge.,even speaker problem and hearing problem on call volume of ring is slow.,phone is not good please don’t buy and the most imp thing when u give it in service the just take money and do nothing I m fed up of this phone, now this phone is a liability on me the camera quality is not good at all for close range it\\'s ok but for distance it\\'s 3rd classI suggest u guys never buy this phone. It\\'s been 20 days since I\\'m using my Samsung M12. There are so many difficulties I\\'m facing since then. It\\'s  honestly not been a good experience so far. 2nd slot of the sim doesn\\'t work most of the time, so can\\'t make requent outgoing calls from the same. Every now and then, I\\'ve to Turn Off & On the Sim2 slot, then only it works fine. Also camera quality is pathetic. One major problem is with the fingerprint sensor. For 1st 10 days, it was working superb, but now the fingerprint  sensor mostly fails in recognising & opening the phone. Also, sometime my phone lags while working on multiple apps. Overall I\\'m very disappointed.Only 2 pros of this phone: Low budget & superb battery backup. I ordered samsung galaxy m12 in blue color. I got used product with open seal. I called the Amazon and they agreed to return it. Thankfully!What I noticed about this model was it looks cheap.. As back is made up of cheap plastic. It\\'s very heavy, which is not comfortable to use. Camera quality was awful for a 48 megapixel camera (Redmi camera is much better in same pixels) . It\\'s shocking and disappointing.I did use this mobile so can\\'t say anything about performance and battery life. Overall it\\'s a series of disappointments.If you have a low budget(8550 after bank discount) then go for it! Else I recommend micromax in 1 or any other brand with good ratings. It\\'s for normal usage, best for old parents who don\\'t need much Features. Anyone other then that, is a BIG NOO. It’s a beast phone with a huge battery.The UI is also very simple and the screen is very lively.Camera is good ( but could’ve been better)At this price point, can’t really complain though - performance is also really for a phone priced under 15,000. 1. Price - Bought during GIF, was one of the cheapest in this config range.2. Camera - Average at best.3. Battery life - Very good.4. Sensors for touch - Good.5. Batteries are heavy and the mob as such is heavy in hand, don\\'t keep them in loose pockets!!6. Browsing - Good, remove all unnecessary apps during first opening and setting up the device.Overall a good device if purchased within 9k. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The fingerprint reader is very sharp.The battery life is the best. It last for almost3 days with less use.The camera is great the macro camera isn\\'t good but the 48 MP camera is the best it works very nicely. Jus the phone is a bit heavy. Otherwise good. The screen resolution is great. I\\'m writing this review from the same phone that I ordered!! An amazing phone in an affordable price.. I ordered the one with 6GB RAM n 128 GB internal storage... overall it\\'s working quite good for me ...it\\'s been 10 days since I got my hands on this phone...fingerprint sensor is working great..battery life is awesome... speakers are working quite good.. n you get quad camera... camera is also pretty nice you just need to adjust the camera settings in order to get good quality pictures... it might not be \\'the best\\' camera for many but it\\'s good guys!!  Overall just go for this without any second thought.... even if you don\\'t like it, Amazon eases your task with its 7 days replacement policy.... so it\\'s not risky to order it online... good delivery service 👍🤗 Worst Samsung Mobile Ever. used so many different Samsung mobiles. but M12 is just cheating by Samsung. The camera quality is so poor. It\\'s just a VGA camera, not 48-megapixel screen colors are very low. I have a galaxy j8 its camera is lower than m12 but it is sharp. don\\'t take they will not return the product. worst Samsung phone ever. lost 13500, and amazon service is being poor day by day. You can\\'t really complain about anything at this price point.Still some things to point out:1. Heavy as a brick 212g!! Will take some time to get used to.2. (For power users) Not full one ui. Uses one ui core. Sound Assistant, Good lock, bixby don\\'t work.3. Not Amoled, TFT screen.4. Not a gaming phoneNow the pros:1. 90hz screen feels great2. 48mp camera is awesome, colors are good too.3. Good battery, 1.5 days backup approxOverall satisfied. This is the best smartphone Samsung has launched in this segment, I received it @12.5k with card offers, and its build quality is Ok, you will get the best features in this range, the camera is gooe, its very smooth in day to day normal use.It has a 6000mAh battery, which almost lasts for around 13-14Hrs in my case. It takes some time in charging, but if we see the battery size, it\\'s normal.cons: you cant use s secure app to secure your  apps and folder, as its not compatible with this phone, and Samsung has compromised in many features.If you dont play heavy games, you can go with this. No doubt product is good but completely disappointed with Amazon because I purchased this in Great Indian Sale @ 10,299/- and next day suddenly product price shows 9,499/-…… The main reason going for samsung is amoled display but my bad may be I should have read specifications but it\\'s a miss.. blindly went by brand Samsung...two major dissapointments1. There is no amoled screen...the screen is not so good where we get lesser rate MI phones with more good specs.2. There\\'s no dual WiFi band... My wifi is set as 5ghz but this phone doesn\\'t show up..I believe there are cheaper phones in MI and Realme with more specs than this Samsung Simply an amazing smartphone from Samsung within 10k, a rival killer launched. Bought this for my dad and he is extremely satisfied with the performance, camera is decent enough, sound quality is pretty good and battery life is awesome!! Grip is good with the combi finish at the back. On the cons, a bit on the heavier side and slightly thicker compared to its rivals, but definitely not a deal breaker. With 90 Hz refresh rate, the pros surely weigh high over the cons, just go for it. So heavy and thick that I have to be very careful about not dropping it on my face when in bed. Screen res is low and pixels can be seen on the screen. Flash light left On on level 5 can burn the phone. More than usual typos on the keyboard while texting or entering OTPs. Fingerprint sensor is super fast and battery back up is great. The phone keeps showing a black screen with logo. And doesn\\'t allow to use the phone even after multiple  tapping on screen or trying to use the fingerprint sensor. It takes almost 2-5 minutes for it to allow to use the phone. The issue persists while tge phone is in use or even when left idle. Hence the battery keeps draining. I tried restarting the phone but it didn\\'t help. But the worst of all was that I switched off the phone, but the phone just turned on on its own. So their switch off doesn\\'t work. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Such good features at this price range makes it a great value for money prospect.Pros:1. Good camera quality.2. phone works without any lags even when more than 3 applications are running.3. Finger print on the side is a great feature and extremely useful than in screen or at the back.Cons:1. Samsung could have invested a little more in the UI but apart from that rest is good. Biggest disappointment is this latest phone  ,not able to connect to 5g, even my old moto phone am able connect to 5g wifi...also see the numeric pad display ... battery life average...check if I can replace it with other model I was strongly buying Samsung phones and advise to friends also because of its robustness. But I have worst experience with Samsung Galaxy M12 as its screen picture and camera quality are third class. Even my old Mi redimi 4 phone has a better camera and screen picture (although I am not promoting it).  It was also the fault of amazon as they launch Samsung phones at the festival without assessing the quality and grading of products from its own professionals to check their worthiness. We people buy it with the name of co\\'s such as samsung and amazon. See, how we are easily deceived by amazon company.I strongly advise people that before buying products of such range, pls check its quality from the market My husband gifted this phone to my Mother. And she just love it. As we all know, Samsung is very user friendly . Any elder person who doesn’t know much about smart phones also can handle it very easily. We ordered blue one And the colour is lovely too. Any one who want 100% latest features with minimal cost can blindly go for it. Nice phone....having long battery life upto 2 to 3 days on one charging... because of 6000mah battery its a bit heavier but fingerprint scanner is on lock key that is awesome thing I have seen......camera is decent too... special selfie camera bright and clear...overall nice phone Is this 48MP by Samsung. The real reason why Samsung is losing to Xiaomi is this. Please do not buy this if camera is important for you.It cannot detect wifi from exactly the same location from where my Samsung On7 Pro can, Redmi 9 can and all others can. Please note that M21 and M12 have network detecting issue. Pros-•Good Battery Life•Good Camera (Back)(Better than M11🙄)•Z Plus Ram(excess ram more than 4GB IF NEEDED)•90Hz adaptive refresh rate•Smooth PerformanceCons-•Front Camera is Average•Too Many Useless apps When you First Buy it•Back Camera not suitable for Night condition•Saturation of Camera is Too High The phone is very goodBattery life is goodCamera is very goodTechnology is goodSamsung service is good for this good phoneOverall it a nice phone  but display quality is very poor  so this phone is good for in its price list. Phone to achcha hai. Main Sri lanka se, par India se mangvaya. rs9499 mei to value lagta hai. Lkn camera 48 hone par b dooor ke fotos ki pictures quality to theek nh. But selfie aur normal distance ke fotos  to theek hai. Meine ise online classes ke liye kharida. So iske liye theek laga. Face ID to andhere me kaam nhi karta. Battery bhi theek hai. Abhi 5dinon se classes ke lie use kia. Aur kya kahun? Amazon me jo b details dekha use dekh kar kharida. Ummid thodi si thi ki camera ke bare me. Iske alawa overall theek hai. It\\'s just 2 days of buying this phone so overall review is not possible. Few things which I want to tell about the phone. It looks and gives feeling of strong built. It\\'s slightly heavier (though I like such phones). Battery backup is superb. Camera quality is good at this price option, front camera has noise in pictures which is common in low budget phones. Display and sound is also justifying the price. With smooth touchscreen it\\'s overall a good budget phone which gives you a feeling of premium built and fair quality. My reason to buy this phone was the strong built quality and simple yet good design (it does not slip from hands). I got instant discount of 1000/- on buying it with HDFC card. The camera is of very poor quality.Screen disply quality is not good as redmi phone don\\'t buy this phone.I will never purchase any Samsung phone in future.Samsung is only doing marketing launching new products every day but quality of the product are very poor.I replaced the redi phone if you used the redimi phone you will never satisfied with Samsung. I had bought this phone for my mom and it had severe call quality issues from the beginning and within 6 months of using it the fingerprint stopped working. I checked with the service centre and they told me that the phone had liquid damage although it never had contact with water or rain. Stay away from this garbage. Total waste of money. Worst camera quality. Front camera is not even like like 1 megapixel camera. If you like to take even a single selfi, then don\\'t go for it. Back camera is also not at all good. My old Samsung phones are far better than this one. Once you buy you have to live with it. So, don\\'t waste your money on this M12 Nice product with in the price range with better battery back up. Camera quality is good..The only bad thing I observed is that wifi is getting connected 2.5ghz bandwidth networks but not getting connected for 5ghz higher bandwidth networks.. Otherwise I would have given 5. I got this phone for my second contact number as my primary handset  battery  runs out very fast and I usually have very long days. But this phone\\'s battery  really  amazed me . It\\'s only 3.5 days I am using  but I can tell you that the battery  backup  is really  good . My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage. Looks good . UI is simple with Android 11.  Weight and grip is good . Screen is responsive . Haven\\'t faced a real show stopper as of yet . Initial opinion is full value for money for those who are looking for descent  phone with a very good battery  life. It is a phone suitable for kids or those who use phone only to make calls and watch videos in youtube. phone is of basic specs and cannot be used for multitasking.it can be used for basic things. nothing more. Loved this color.Cons:* heating issue*screen heating while charging*doesnt feel fast charging ( adapter provided is not 15w)* Not feeling 90 hz refreshing rate* battery drain fast ( not feeling 6000 mah battery life )*weight is little high*sound quality is not good (sometimes cant hear phone ringing) Pros:Camera quality goodVideo quality goodNice colorGood at this price (brought @10499)On time deliveryHope build quality of Samsung will be good The M12 is very low quality product in terms of display which has very faded colors and the screen is a magnet for fingerprints and other forms of dirt.It does not even have high speed WiFi (5Ghz) which I was expecting.Compared this to very marginally higher priced M21 which is leaps ahead in terms of specs and product quality. Below average phone in this price range. Battery lasts only 24hrs with very normal use. Camera is below standards. Processor is not very impressive. Mi Note 10 would have been a better choice. The Phone is best for middle range buyers,Negative in phone means 1000/2000 price has to reduce because of their given features .And remaining over is fine with mid rangeFingerprint is fastBattery is very goodCamera back is okay but front 8mp is some what good (because of this price has to reduce)Processor is not good for gamers.,This phone is very good to who use very less .,or normal users .  Like only calls msgs and social networks chatting.If you want camera good means don\\'t buy this phone.Screen resolution is less due to that HD videos were not in original some what blur or like below HD. There is only 1 problem I observed that  the internet is not working properly. Videos are running intermittently even on high speed Wi-Fi. Web pages also does not load as expected.Other than that working fine and all the expected feature in this range. Its fingerprint sensor in power button. Good batry backupGood Camera  for this range i have seen all other phone in this range but samsung is the best in camera.Buildup quality is feel like mid range phoneScreen is so nice like amoledSound output is so clear and punchy.Samsung UI is better all other chinies smart phone.Screen is very big phone waight distribution is very comfirty.If you wana give this phone to your love one i will 100% recomend you trust me you will never regreatI have also buy 2 quantity for personal and home uses.I got it in 8549 in festive sale with HDFC credit card Worst Phone I have ever Seen with this price. Nothing is good except battery. Camera quality is very poor, Phone is very heavy, Sound quality is very poor. I will never recommend to anyone to buy Samsung Phone. One of my friend had recommended to go with Samsung phone. I think he has no idea about the quality of phone. Bad product heavy weight if you use one plus. I bought this for mailing and what\\'s app so it\\'s working ok. At this price it\\'s a quality product but don\\'t expect performance like one plus or high priced phones. Battery life doesn\\'t seems to perform like 6000 it\\'s bad People who are judging this without realizing it\\'s price needs to calm down. I bought this for my cousin during Great Indian Festival at Rs. 8600. Excellent product, Clean Samsung UI which is the best in the world, 90 Hz refresh rate which is working fine without any lag, Battery backup is real good. People who are saying camera needs improvement, they are not gonna give you Flagship level camera in the phone which is less than 10000 Rs. If you want cleaner UI, you can definitely buy this. & it\\'s stupidity to judge a phone by Gaming performance. This phone is a daily driver & not a gaming device. Samsung Galaxy M12 is an excellent handset. I am writing this review after of using the mobile for three weeks. The battery back up is unimaginable . Once it gets fully charged it runs for around 40 hours with frequent usage of internet. This set consists every unique feature that Samsung offers. The camera is good but not excellent. Nevertheless the sound of loudspeaker is little down. That is to say if the volume is not highest then it becomes a bit hard to listen.To conclude i would say that the configuration which this handset consists within this price range is just beyond imagination. This is an excellent handset Samsung launched. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good, Don\\'t dwell on the negetive review. Camera is pretty good, UI is very user friendly, Fingerprint sensor is at side on the lock screen button so no back side look is clean & the sensor works perfectly and flawlessly. Long battery life. This is good product battery life is awesome internal memory is good 128GB good for gaming is mid range mobile.lttle bit heavy weight. Acchi mobile hai 12 hajar ke andar game khelne k liye v best hai.battery v bahut chalti hai.but camera utna accha nahi h.baki sab thik h wajan thoda jyada hai Samsung is simply cheating customers by booming the non credible features , the given features are just a paper tiger ( only for advertising ) don\\'t misunderstand it will perform. it is just a budget phone nothing rather thanDon\\'t think against the given features by Samsung . if you need a budget phone , can buy it else if you want a performance phone please Don\\'tOnly battery is good bought on  Amazon festival sale. After 10 days received phone. To my surprise phone was not charging and on trouble shooting found issue in charging cable. Didn\\'t expect this quality from Samsung. Delay  of delivery is pinching too. I could have bought in a in person store and avoided all these hassles. raised return but didn\\'t get call even after 15days was forced to used phone and buy my own cable. if something goes wrong only god can save.. don\\'t trust amazon nor these vendors.. amazon stopped picking my support calls. Galaxy M12 review after 2 weeksPros:Battery lifeOperating system (one ui core)90hz bright displayDecent camera qualityWeight distribution was good,feels lightDesign looks goodCons:1.Not sure with performance,day to day tasks are quite good,but for gaming i think it os not suitable2.Camera doesn\\'t have fancy features but still fineFinally at low expectations i bought this product to my mom but i like it more than my phone for some time.Samsung is a brand.I had disabled most of ads,blotware and heavy apps in order to give best experience.Best for day to day use ☺️ Camera quality is good if compared to other phones in this range. Phone feels really fast, thanks to the 90Hz screen and 6gb RAM with a fast processor. I bought in under exchange offer for 10,000 ( 6gb variant ) and I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Go for it if you are tight on a budget yet want a phone with good specs. Much better than similar budget Chinese phones. But note that front camera could have been better, although it is 8mp but still gives grainy images. Phone was delivered in perfectly new condition. The weak point is camera both side is really not so good an average quality of camera but Okey!Second one is charging speed is tooo slow 15 W 😂 about 3 hours + take to full up!But I brought for my uncle so I think this was the best smartphone for him..Under 10k superb smartphone.(Grate indian festival sale offer) Pros:Good display, good battery life.Cons:1. Pros are already present in other phones.2. Camera quality is very bad. Pictures are not very grainy and not sharp. Colors look dull. Photos are comparable to older nokia phone pictures.3. Touchscreen is not very responsive and also not smooth.4. One of the biggest con is that it does not support 5GHz wifi.Overall, if you are looking for budget phone i would suggest better go for redmi note series.Even though it a budget phone it still doesn\\'t justify its price tag. There are much better phones in the market at this price range. Excellent smartphone, excellent picture, value buy. All features are excellent in this price range. The picture & sound quality is very good. Only problem is the charging port is not universal. Thus I have bought a charging cable only. Otherwise excellent. The fingerprint sensor is on mode button. it is not comfortable. Lightly stuck the back touch button. Camera quality is not in 48 pixel and front not good.It is over the look not good and fully not bad. But I am not satisfied the amount of worth Please don\\'t buy this...The data conctivity was really terrible...And I tried changing Sim card to my old phone..In old ph the data was connecting good and speed also good....And while I am in voice call, when I turn on the speaker only the other can hear my voice if I off speaker, they are unable hear my voice.Worest product!!!😢😢😢Please don\\'t go with this!!!No screen recorder, no shortcut yo screenshot, but unwanted apps will download without our permission from galaxy store.Back camera is also not up to the mark!!!Very very bad experience!!! Good to go piece.Few cons which I have noticed:• Specs may say camera megapixels are higher, but not in par with MI phones.• Cannot run dual apps for applications other than messenger.• Sudden issue arised in first week of use where speakers started screaming harshly with noise (trrrrrrrr) whenever some sound played(notifications, music). Luckily resolved after a reboot. (saw some other users having similar issues over support forum) Samsung M12.  Camera clarity is absolutely worst and bad normal Camera phone is better than  ,And  mobile is  getting over heated  badly  in all times when Iĺ operate, over all Samsung M12 performance is not good.i purchased this mobile for camera purpose. I just blindly trusted Amazon before buying Samsung M12, now in not happy with this.One of \"Best Worst mobile\" in Samsung series.Amazon thought me very  good lesson, purchasing mobile from them, never ever I won\\'t purchase anything in Amazon , By these Amazon heir trusted  and confidence.  🙏🙏🙏 Thanq. I have been using this phone for last 2 months.The battery backup of this phone is too good. It lasts for 2 or 3 days with low usage. Camera is good.The fingerprint sensor responds quickly.In this price range it is worthy. Horrible..bought  this phone on launch date.camera quality is worst..and the performance is below average. Don\\'t waste your money by buying  this.Since I brought  it under replacement policy not able to return  it now. Worst phone from samsung Hi friends don\\'t purchase this phone with any expectation.Problem.1. Phone over heating during while charging2. Camera not equal to 48 MP3. Finger print reader not upto mark.It\\'s on ordinary phone under 10k.Really disappoint with this product. Samsung failed to maintain their standard. Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor. 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly. True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos. The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome. 16.55 cm infinity V display is cool. In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices. Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery. Unnecessary samsung apps, which you can\\'t uninstall. If you are not tech savvy, you are gonna face lot of problems. All the unnecessary apps will be automatically downloaded. There are pre installed apps, you neither can uninstall nor block notifications.Camera is worst in this price range. No fast charging opting available. Battery life is good. Finger print reader is ok. Mobile is too bulky.. and thickness is too much 9.7 mm. Not looking like modern phone. Samsung pls work on weight and thickness. Customer won\\'t require big battery give 5000mah is enough. Give some modern look with max 8.5 mAh thickness.. talk about procesdor its entry level processor of 6-7 k phones. But u give in 11k phone.. atleast use G35. If you\\'re not a heavy gamer or user you can definitely go for this this is a budget phone and excellent for running moderate and lit apps for our daily use ... and there will be no lag and have a very good battery life ... camera is average and UI is good Please everyone attention don\\'t but this Mobile because this Mobile is not good battery backup same as 5000 mah battery  and I used 6000 mah battery other Mobile tecno spark 7t that Mobile\\'s Mobile battery is more batter than m12And camera quality is very  bad experience in this mobile only name is 48 mega pixels  but quality is 16 mega pixels  aur front camera is very poorPlease everyone don\\'t buy this mobile I you want to buy please but tecno spark 7t same features in this Mobile I wanted to have a phone 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM and 7000 mAH battery with large display and good picture quality in budget. This phone has satisfied me a lot, however this phone has 6000 mAH battery. I am much satisfied now. After one year or more than one year, It should not be slow and hang. I will rate this phone 8 number out of 10.However it\\'s a better deal. 13 to 14 k you will get better than this Samsung m12. The day I started use, phone started hanging,I should honestly give the reviewGo for other phone it doesn\\'t give 6000mah woser than my old Lenovo phone 3500mah.Camera is average they give lots number of MP but not suited at all , only good thing is finger print senso even that too I doubt about it how long days I can have without problem.Finally I m not satisfied with M12, 6GB Ram phone is not working as the attractive description given below the list. Hopeless product Quite disappointed with the phone. Recently bought. Already the battery charging is very slow. The camera is mediocre. It lacks night mode and the picture quality is average. Colours are not rue to colour. Will not recommend this phone. As a regular smartphone user i will rate this item 4 out of 5 because in such price it should be much better like in 48 mp camera the picture quality is not as good as my expectation. Fingerprint and face unloch is quite good and the selfie camera really excellent. As 6000mAh battery the battery should last upto 1day and a half but in standard use the battery quality decreases upto 29% in the evening (I charged the phone around 6.40 am on that day). This problem that I faced I had share with you all guys, before buying this phone please think a lot and tge decisions is completely upon you. Thank You, Arnab Bindu Chakraborty Amazing battery life. Discharge is only 1% for overnight.Display can be much better. Expected a better display from samsung. Vivo and oppo have a better display interms of brightness and pixel density.Finger print on power button is good and quick.Plastic back is kind of disappointing.Overall performance is ok but not what the ADS on amazon show you. Don\\'t see the negative reviews.  After using 10days I am writing this reviews .Back camera excellentFront camera okBattery excellentCharging Full for 2.30 hours approxLittle more weight, but not so heavyDisplay excellentNo heating,  no hangingVolume and speakers excellentAround 10k budget excellent.Samsung is best brand and provenThanks to Amazon Actually I am a fan of samsung.I brought this variant with 11k @ diwali offer.I thought to buy other mobile instead of Samsung in this price where I can get additional features, but surprisingly samshng m12 made me feel good after buying this phone.Main thing is performance no lag even I am playing asphalt 9, Ram management is super and samsung UI  is great experience  as you can see in high end mobiles.Charging is fast and long last.Disappointed thing is only 📷.Totally I am 😊 with this 📱 in this price Range.Recommended and for it, As of now 6gb varaint is about 14k wait for drop 11k and proceed. Bought this for my parents and they love it. As I am using A52 myself, I feel M12 delivers at its price range and then some. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Having 90 Hz Adaptive display is wonderful.Camera is decent as well, with options for Macro (attached) and Wide Angle being good as well. Haven\\'t experienced any lags on medium workloads.Android 11 with updated UI, Smart View, Dolby Atmos, Good Battery Life are some highlights.Very satisfied with the purchase. The battery life is way better than any of the smartphone in the same range and the person is also good as it has 6 gb ram but camera quality can be little bit better and they could have improved the processor. Good thing is that all apps are optimised which is good for the battery life .It\\'s a great product if you are a kind of person who wants a smartphone which has a longer battery life ,a good speed and 90hz refresh rate and who doesn\\'t do gaming in the smartphone. i feel like cheated by amazon and samsung its not even a month and my phone stopped working with no reason this was not expected and visited to samsung centre as well but they were saying that only non warranty sets are getting fixed during this lockdown period then i asked them to fixed my set out of warranty (i was ready to pay as well) then they said that your mobile display is need to be change and there is no display available in India for my phone and from that day i am not having any smartphone as i am saving money and trying to bear this pain n loss.amazon hats off to u cheaters. Got this as a replecement for my samsung M11. The M12 is way better than M11. Better photo quality, better performance and faster performance. I got the blue phone which looks decent as well. I feel it\\'s worth the 13500 I paid for it. The phone received in a day. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery. The phone\\'s display, camera, battery life is good. But one issue I found it. Recently I realize it that once I receive incoming call am not able hear it for couple of minutes / sometimes no voice heard from other side and finally I need to close the call ....initially I thought this issue should be from sender phone but now I realize it is in my phone...it appears that either there is problem in my phone or in model. Samsung and Amazon to look into this issue & replace it with good phone on immediate  basis. - battery life is super- camera quality is ok in such price segment- bought this phone at 8599  with 1039 rs credit card discount- build quality  is best Not amoled display but at this price you don\\'t deserve amoled, it is an hd display but u deserve new android 11 but it is based on android 10 and needed the \" one ui \" updated version. My old phone m30 is 2 year old but it has awesome features in \" one ui \" but this has not,  hope software update gave all this features.  But battery life is awesome and camera is average. 🙂🙂 Phone is fabulous and it is worth for those who r looking the budget phone .All features are loaded un customise manner in this phone. One should nit go for 15k range phone of all features are available in 10k..Think wisely... The Phone is Nice, Mai 3 din se use kr rha hun ye phone aur ye phone thik thak kaam kr rha hai Maine heavy games  bhi khele isme high graphics  me wo bhi thik chale, overl all mai agar dekhun to iss range me ye phone samsung ka hote huve bhi Chinesebrand ko iss budget me takkar deta hai aur  android  11 ka experience  bhi dekhne ko mil rha hai jo ki badhiya lga mujhe.》》But ek cheez mujhe jada disappoint kiya aur wo hai eska 48mp ka camera isme eski quality  aur behtar kr skte the jo ki true 48mp ki tarah pic ki quality  nhi deta Samsung  brand hote huve bhi aisa thik nhi hai. Mobile lene k 15 din baad hi.. Uske loudspeaker m problem hone lgi... Aur 5-6 din baad hanging problem hone lgi.... Pros:1. Entry level budget smart phone2. Battery levels are amazing3. 90Hz refresh is plusCons:1. Finger print sensor does not picks up elderly person\\'s finger2. Face lock is also not up to the mark3. Brightness levels of the display are not up to the mark when compared to other 12k to 15k M series budget phones The phone is good. Of course it justifies its price range. But this phone has a low audio output,so putting a speaker during call,or while playing other media files, the sound is not very high even when kept at full volume. Other than that, the phone is great. After 1 month use, some serious sensors are missing which will make google maps almost useless on the phone. Camera quality is good only for day time that too depends on mood of the camera. Sluggish phone you can see phone saving photo even after quiting the camera app. Serious processor problems. I bought 6/128 variant and felt sorry for whoever bought 4 gig version. Good for minimal users and for saving tonns of photos via apps but not from the phone\\'s camera. BGIM was surprisingly good on the phone thanks to its large screen. Also good for online classes and OTT viewers. Literally value for money in this prize by Samsung.I could blindly recommend you this phone if you are samsung lover..Everything is just latest...Pros:-Type c port6000mah massive batteryAndroid 11One UI OS 3.1  no blaotwares at allFingerprint sensor is blazing fast works 10 out of 10 times..Amazingle processor is on 8nm technology..Cons:-HD + displayFace unlock not reliableCharger is 15 watt which could be of 20 wattsOverall a all rounder phone in 11,000  by reliable brand samsung. Worst phone hangs a lot from the day of purchase various problems. Keyboard gets cut in half during some apps hang while calling ... Not able to pick up calls smoothly. In almost one year, 3 times display screen has color leak issue (without any handset fall/physical damage) which company never covers under warranty. 3 times paid from my pocket Rs.4800 each time to rectify the issue. Highly disappointed with company poor development policy. Planned to never buy samsung products in future. Model : Samsung m12 6gb RAM 128 ROM (Black)Bought @ 10,350rsBattery life - 8/10Fingerprint, face recognition- 9/10Camera Quality-8/10Sound Quality- 6/10 (sound quality not expected)Ram and Processor - 8/10Cons:• Sound quality not up to the mark !• Somehow heavy• Camera quality is not so good• Data cable length is too short !• Fast Charging option didn’t  works well ! ( takes  more time to charge ) Lovely 4 camera design though no 5ghz wifi and 90hz don’t know what’s the difference between normal or this. But overall at this price point loaded. Better than Chinese. Yes of course Unnecessary apps could be reduced that come preinstalled. Review after 20 days use,Phones battery life is awesomeCan last all day, I charge once in couple of days,Wi fi calling working perfectly fineFingerprint and face unlock is fast enough,Overall it\\'s Good phone in this price range Using this for more than a month now for not so heavy usage.Battery Life is VERY impressiveCharger is although 18W, still provides more than expected speed of charging.Side mounted fingerprint is pretty quick.Speakers provide just above average sound.Camera is good although not as good as proclaimed 48MP, wide angle and portrait mode available.All and all, this phone has not disppointed me.But would suggest to research other options like Redmi note 10 and compare them yourselves. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The phone is hanging and goes off on its own. Not even a week the phone was used and started giving problem, video attached for your reference....Due to lock down I was not able to return the phone as the site was not functional and gave me an error currently we cannot pickup or drop any product at your mailing address due to covid-19 restrictions.... 8 ന്റെ പണിAmazon നെ ഉം പൊക്കിപിടിച്ച് നടന്ന എനിക്കും കിട്ടി നല്ല സ്വയമ്പൻ സാധനം BBD ൻ order ചെയ്തത് Samsung M12 6/128GB ഇന്ന് കിട്ടിയത് 4/64 GB varientഅപ്പോൾ കൂടെ Backcover ഉം screen gurd ഉം orderചെയ്തിരുന്നു😭Replacement ന്കൊടുത്തപ്പോ 6/128 സാധനം ഇല്ല😓(vidum order cheyan aanel kanikund Athena agane😒) കൂടെ വാങ്ങിച്ച Backcoverഉം Sreengurd Return അടിച്ചു അപ്പളാ പണി screenguard ന് Return ന്ഇല്ലത്രേ 😡എനിക്കെന്തിനാ Screen gurd അച്ചാർ ഇട്ടാനോ 😏വെറുതേ BBD പറഞ്ഞ് orderകൊടുതട്ട് എന്തായലും ആ 150 Rs പോയികിട്ടി😢😶 Am using M21 from past one year then I ordered this can say M21 is better then M12 design and display but it\\'s also good not bad I am writting this review after using this mobile for almost 2 months.When connected my laptop via mobile Hotspot through this phone it drops off for every 20 minutes. I have to restart the mobile then need to connect again. It is very annoying.I didn\\'t have this problem with my previous mobile and also I don\\'t have any coonectivity issues with my wife\\'s mobile if I use mobile Hotspot on it. Mywife\\'s mobile is lesser in configuration when compared to this mobile. We both have same mobile connection which is Vodafone.I don\\'t know what to to do. This is my solid rankingafter using Galaxy M12 for a fortnight.Ovweall performance is quite good and comfortable.It would be better if atleast 25 w charger is provided with a big battery.Some critics on you tube had informed \" 4 to 5 problems\" in all(?) M series phones but I have found none of them in this product although it is of very reasonable price.I am 85 today and yet enjoy my ph. Without any difficulty.SAMSUNG has never any excuse|! I bought this phone before 2 months, Camera is very poor 48 MP it is poorer than 13 MP.I wanted to login my company email, before that device needs to be enrolled with Microsoft Intune company portal. The company portal will only allow when Device encryption feature will be available in phone, but it does not have.This is very important hardware features that secure your phone,s data. So this phone is use less for me to configure outlook.So Guys..Be aware if you are buying any phone and which phone\\'s price is falling day by day... The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Not quite good decent product but price is too high don\\'t go for itMicromax in note 1 is a much better choice than this in every terms like camera display performance and design so i think u should not buy this phone because there are a lots of more option in this price range from micromax ,redmi ,poco, realme, i bought IT for 9000 in sale. Phone does not support 5 GHz band for wifi due to this slow internet compared to my old phonePhone is not at all slim, thick phoneIt has a 6000Mah battery but still it drains very fast compared my old oppo F11.Camera performance is just okay.Finger scanner is placed on the side of the body, not comfortable to usePhone is without screen guard and back cover. brand could have provided in the box it would have not added much cost to them. In this price range for the moment one of the best deals. 6000mAh battery really does the job. Fingerprint reader is sensitive but if you using mobile with cover it becomes difficult due to its position. Camera not great not terrible. Touch sensitivity is not that great sometimes it slides when I want to open an app but not that major problem. If you want something with high battery and RAM and storage this is the mobile. Finger print reader & camera quality excellent. It senses quickly & good resolution as far as camera is concerned. Battery life depends on usage.Moreover, From my experience  Samsung\\'s after sale service is excellent This phone is no different from other Samsung phones with respect to the usage speed. While the battery is fantastic, camera is ok. There too much lag while using phone. The worst thing is I noticed all these after my return period is over. I am using this phone since 5 months and overall performance is good but camera is not like 48 mega pixels..  when you take a picture, the picture is cracked.. not clear visible..Battery life is very good.. 2 day backups in normal use.. and day in gaming use.. Using it for about 4 months now. Heavy phone although has plastic body works fine storage is great charges fast Not yet facing any difficulty. Overall the mobile is great at this price, although screen is not as bright & speaker is just above average, not as loud as required. battery is very good and goes on for  more than one and half day easily..., camera is good and you can click some very good and bright photos. Overall good option in this price range ( best feature is it has 6gb ram, 128 gb internal memory at this price.) The touch is bad. The mobile is heavy. Battery is good. Also, fast charge. Camera is good outdoors. But, low light and indoor quality is not great. Overall, not bad. Okay for regular use. Not for photography or playing games अमेज़न मेने आपके ऐप्प सेsamsung M126GB Ram 128 GB Rom6000 MH बैटरीका फ़ोन खरीदा आपसे कोई शिकायत नहीहैपरSamsungसे शिकायत है में पिछले 2 साल सेJ6 इस्तेमाल कर रहा हैबहुत अच्छा और मजेदार फ़ोन हैबस बेटरी कम है बाकी उसके फंक्शन एक दम अच्छे और usefull हैM12 से में ना खुश हूं When I received the mobile, neither the speaker nor the mic was working so I did a restart then it started working.This happened frequently so I had to restart frequently. I decided to replace the item as it was faulty but the new product I received has the same issue. Unfortunately this is not returnable so my money is wasted.Very bad experience, please avoid buying this. Handset is likeable, no doubts. But the quality of display, camera and processor are not full in criteria as mentioned. I have sent a picture captured by 48 mp resolution, you will see that is not clear and  proof that the quality of camera is not good. Display resolution shows to see the diaplay you need to tilt the phone. Sometimes phone went hanged also so that the processor is not good. I have exchanged my old phone which was in well running condition now I am missing that was best against this one. That was solid in his promises. Thankyou Using it from last 8 months, worth it totally 👍 used iPhone earlier and then bought this phone, one thing noticed is battery life, no comparison at all with iPhones, way better than iPhones and many smartphones of this range.Second one is Screen resolution, top quality.Third pro is storage, better than iPhone.Camera is average compared to iPhones and other smartphones so if you want good smartphone with good battery life, storage, screen resolution then must go for this phone. Totally worth it in this criteria Not worth of moneyNot aviled for any special futureIts does noteven have the normal features that other mobile have😔😔😔😔😔 1. A good phone in this range2. Exynos 850 may not sound a great processor for gaming or multitasking, but it actually does a great job.3. No heating issues. (Playing games like FF for 1-2 hrs or attending consecutive meetings on Meet, Zoom & Teams or doing consecutive classes on Unacademy or Adda won\\'t cause a problem)4. Although the camera quality disappointed me, as their remains a high expectation from Samsung Cameras.5. But overall Samsung lives upto its name, with great service centres and customer support. As Samsung shows its quality in every launch, this is also a good product in mid range mobiles. All things are good if u r an average user, for high performance gaming & photography other high end models are preferred. A good buget phone with great battery life.I usually use it for gaming because I can\\'t buy a gaming phone it to expensive. But I can play seemingly all kind of game without lag(I dont mean games like genshin imapact).Overall goodValue for money:8/10 (reason low resolution  comparedd to other  budget smart phone  under 12000)Camera:9/10 (under this price tag the camera  qualityy is good)Chipset:8/10(under this price tag)Battery:10/10(best in this price tag)Overall:7/10 Battery life is very good. Built quality is also very nice. Camera quality also very good. Fingerprint reader work perfectly and also fast. Overall the phone is very good. Value for money. One of the best choice this phone in this price range. One UI 3.1 and 90hz display makes the user experience heavenly. It has a 8nm processor and really power efficient. Without compromising in the perfomance it gives me more than 2 days of battery life. Camera is decent and the colour reproduction is very good.No hanging or heating problems.It can run high end games in low to medium settings as well but I won\\'t recommend this for gaming purpose.Lot\\'s of features included with the One UI 3.1 core which I liked the most. Overally a great phone for Normal users 👌 MIc is not working properly I already bought M31 same problem with that mobile also .  My mistake is forgot that purchase and again same series phone since have good confidence over Samsung but they never maintaining good quality  . They need lot improvement over testing the product before launching in market Another good product from Samsung Galaxy M12.  Battery life is very good. Performance is not as good as Qualcomm Snapdragon, but its ok. Only you will find performance difference when you play games. Features are excellent. Camera Quality also good. Value for Money in this range. Best Battery, Rear Camera, And fast finger print unlockBut Samsung Galaxy M12 it\\'s Not Support Wifi Dual Band (5GHz)Only Support Single Band (2.4GHz)Overall it\\'s Best Only Under Rs. 8500 I have purchased this on 6th sep with 6 months free screen replacement. My phone screen broke in a month and when i go back to samsung service center, they denied for screen replcement. Also samsung customer care is saying amazon will do it. Amazon is saying samsung will do it.They are making fool of customers. Satisfied with product. Camera quality is okay. Other than that, its a samsung, whoever is used to samsung will love the functioning of this device too.If you are a samsung lover, definately go for it. If you are conscious about new features, gaming, camera quality other options might be available at given price point. Its great for day to day tasks and surfing internet, social media and all. Thumbs up for Samsung Just stopped working after few hoursIt seems it has a bug. It doesn\\'t work for quite a few hours in the evenings. Not sure how long I buy my first ever & may be last Samsung Phone because mobile phone is good for daily use only the issue which I was noticed when I trying to connect internet  & opened mobile hotspot & connected my laptop or other device  the speed of internet showing below 100 kb/sec it’s very worst & even I connected my same laptop & other devices with another mobile and same network it’s showing speed above  500kb/sec the thing is only disappointed me. Its total value for money. It can handle regular usage like social media, video streaming very well.. fingerprint unlock is pretty fast... Camera and display are on bit downside but to be realistic at this price range its pretty decent. Go for it if you are looking alternative of low cost chinese. I don\\'t know why they have mentioned as 48 mega pixel , I am big fan of Samsung.Prior to this mobile I have used Samsung j6 its just 13mega pixel camera quality is just awesome. M12 camera quality is very poooooor.One more issue is Amazon not accepting return until if you receive a defective piece. The phone is a good one to use. It is a 6.5 inch but is handy to use for its balance. It has a 6000 mah battery which gives it a great battery backup with a decent fast charger. It has also a good UI( One UI 3.0). Overall it\\'s a good smartphone which can beat some flagship phone too. Well if the question comes what I dislike  about  the phone is absolutely  nothing  it is a proper handy phone allows  to have a well grip. The quad camera  allows  to take  a full depth  of a picture enrich  in color and to take a true tone photo. The finger print is fast like thunder like a touch of your finger and opens in front  of you. The battery  is cool to use you could  say a PowerBar with phone and the make and feel of the phone is like your bide on the wedding night. A cool phone to use and recommend  others. Nothing  found against except it is  a little bulky ,and plastic on back is ordinary ,but it is budget phone and can not be compared with S21 or I phone .It is good for above ordinary use with occasional gaming, Battery easily last for more than two days,I can say you get more than you pay photo. In day light is very good ,uploaded photo is in low light at around 6 pmMovies on Netflix were enjoyable with good sound and colour I have received the product today but as mentioned box in the details while purchasing in the box available hand set,manual, ejection pin,adopter. In the box only I have received hand set and adopter, not received the manual and ejection pin. Without ejection pin how should I put my SIM card in my mobile. I am very unhappy with that. Still I am not checking the other details in the phone. I am rated 1 star out of 5 bcoz of above issue. First impression is best impression here I am not seen very in happy. Just Go For It:Great Value!! Awesome Product!! Great Service!! Samsung is the real deal 👌👌👌Better than the Advertisement!!6GB Ram 6000 Battery! Good Screen!! Decent Processor!! Every thing you need to do Is but a Breeze for M12.Last but not the least!! KNOX Security!! You can Trust Samsung with your life.I am thankful and grateful to Samsung for a great companion!! 👍 Regretful encounter wth this M12 order , dated 14 th Aug \\'21.Gifted this product to my sister, it\\'s been just 3 mths today. Display not working, unable to start n poor battery performance.Showed at Samsung gallery for review they said mother board needs to b changed whc will cost 8 k.Please do justice to the lil investments we make around.Kindly oblige, acknowledge n respondNeed full replacement to consider.Team Amazon n collabs. I am using this phone from 5 days, on this basis I am just giving my feedback.1) Fingerprint reader is different as compare to other Android phones, and it\\'s take some time to detect Fingerprint.2) Rear Camera quality is good but it\\'s not like 48 mega pixels.3) Battery backup is good but its charge slowly.4) Overall performance is good with this price. Best phone in this price range!Pros1) Camera is best in class. The photos clicked are so great in quality.2) Phone is fast as anything. Even the heaviest of apps open in a jiffy.3) Fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone in less than a second.4) Colour and looks are so pleasant.Cons1) Display is okay, somewhat yellowish.2) Phone is a little bulky and heavy on hand. I like the focus mode, that helps to keep apps that are needed active to avoid unwanted notifications to distract ones work. Dark mode and eye protection is also good feature that protects eye. Inbuilt Smart mode helps detect the fraud/spam calls without any external app installation. Camera quality is good with good zoom capability. Phone is light and slim with good responsive touch sensor. Overall Phone is very good for my purchase budgetof Rs9500. It\\'s a great phone from Samsung in budget series. I will not waste your time nor mine.so coming to the point all things are positive so I\\'m gonna tell you negative fingerprint reader is on the side on power button It\\'s just okay quality. And other thing is cameras are also good but front one is just OK. But overall in this price range it\\'s awesome and if you are confused between redmi 10 and Samsung m12  just go for it.It\\'s just great and above all it\\'s Samsung, 😉 Slighly bigger than M10, M21 amd M31. Other than 6 GB Ram 128 GB storage and 6000 MaH battery, everything is ordinary. They could have given a better screen for this price. Even charging cable is shorter than optimum. Touchscreen issues, Display issues, Bad Hardware and Delay in Mobile. When brough mobile normal apps looks finme still slow display but few apps like phone pe etc these keys are not matching and responses are slow overal display issues and touchscreen issues are there . unfortunately i installed phone pe and found this issue after return window and now not sure what needs to be done very bad display and touchscreen not worth to buy this mobile. I tried all updates etc within 7/8 days have issues . Touch is extremely bad and is irritating as it doesn’t recognize and hangs up.Have to lock and unlock several times to get other apps working.When phone is locked, despite double / triple tapping the screen, it doesn’t light up or show option to unlock, we have to press the side button yo light the screen which is more frustrating.Extremely slow even though it’s 4 gb ram If you are interested in a budget camera phone, this one isn\\'t for you.This phone is pretty smooth. Works for people who don\\'t use phones much like me.Battery life is awesome and I\\'m enjoying it but cable is a bit short.Overall good phone, would recommend this one if u are really low on budget but if you can spend a bit more, just get the Samsung m30s or m31.This phone just needs improvement in camera and otherwise this is a decent budget phone. The mobile comes with lots of bloatware. Needs to be trimmed. Also the contact list is not easy to use when a name has more than 1 contact. Most importantly, searching thru various notifications is difficilt. Privacy is at risk because the pictures keep changing everytime one presses the power button to start - which means all our actions are being recorded somewhere.I do not use thw Fingerprint reader but still it is asking to rate. So gave 1 star raring. The Camera is not good it feels like a 13 MP not 48MP the battery life is normal it will last 1 day easily and will charge the full battery in 3hrs but the phone is heavy more than 2000 grams and I have also tried COD Mobile in medium setting the 90hz refresh rate help in gaming and the overall gaming experience is fine. I would suggest you to go for this phone if you are only a normal user, it is not made for heavy gaming Average phone at this range, phone gets hanged while using some basic apps. Battery life is ok doesn\\'t seem like 6000mah which makes phone heavy , camera quality is average. Only best thing  about the phone is its look.All together I feel you can get a better phone at this price i love samsung ab jab redme ke hi parige me samsung mil raha haj to zabardsti ka add wala phone lene ka kya faida samsung lo This review is after using phone for 1 week.Likes-Under 10k budget  this phone is very good to use, it\\'s having  almost features like a 14-15k phone,camera quality is also good.My usage of phone is more would say whole day so by the EOD I left with 20-30%batteryDislikes-what I was in need of I dint get that is Wifi-calling option in this phone.Main drawback is if battery reaches below 40- 50 it takes really long time to get fully charged up. I am using this for more than a month as of now ....This is a very good Product at the price which Samsung is selling. It says it is MADE IN INDIA.I really like the Battery Backup for me it is lasting for more than 30 hours with moderate uses. Like ( Youtube ,  calling and Hotspot uses)COns : -It is Bulking and feels heavy in pocketFinger print scanner is not up to the mark .. some times it is unable to unlock . इस फोन में कई कमियां है जैसे इसकी नोटिफिकेशन ट्यून बंद करने पर भी नोटिफिकेशन आने पर बजती है।इसको चार्ज़िंग पर लगाने और फोन के चार्ज होने का कोई भी संकेत नहीं मिलता है।नोटिफिकेशन से सम्बंधित प्रकाश संकेत इसमे उपलब्ध नहीं है जिससे स्क्रीन लॉक होने पर नोटिफिकेशन की जानकारी नहीं हो पाती है।भार में भी ये अन्य फोनो से काफी ज्यादा है।कैमरा तो चार चार है पर पिक्चर की गुणवत्ता संतोषजनक नहीं है।वाई फाई की रेंज बहुत ही कम है एक दीवार के बाद डाउनलोड की स्पीड अत्यंत कम हो जाती। Mere life ka sabse khrab anubhavMai aap Sab se kahunga is samsung M12 mobile ko kabhi mat lena ...

The camera is very excellent, better than every single phone in this budget and even higher.Battery is best!!!!!, its battery is THE BEST BATTERY, it works for 3 to 4 days - even though i use it for big tasks like running games and etc.Screen is as good as Iphone\\'s, screen works very fast, refresh rate is V GOOD.never lagged, very good proccessor. It\\'s a complete package at such an attractive price. Blue color looks amazing and camera quality is good. Monster battery of 6000 mAh is good for 2 days of normal use. Overall really happy. The product has so many issues,  I am adding experience by using it for  3 days .It has network  issueIt has hanging  problemIt has bettey issuesIt has problem with heatingMy overall rating is 1 out of 10 .Please  please  don\\'t go for this phone The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Got struck on the setup screen due to touch is less responsive . Amazon  seller had delivered a malfuncted phone to me.Disappointed by Amazon atleast you should do quality check for the product your selling. Complete waste of time and waste of money.If there is option for negative star I will definitely give that also.Disappointed Camera ia average, but for decent activity this is really a good buy. Current 6gb varient is available for 10500 after applying offers is a great deal you can definitely buy it. But not for heavy users. I ordered this product on 20 July 2021 and immediately it got delivered within a week on 29 July 2021.Mobile camera is good.Battery is betterPerformance and storage is goodOverall it\\'s good mobile for normal android usersThis review is not for  users who play high end games (like ping, free fire etc) in mobile First impressions:Pros : 2 days battery life if internet is used constantly.RAM is enough to handle the heavy apps smoothly.Runs on latest Android version and Samsung UI.Cons:So so camera quality as compared to similar price range products. Overall in this budget the phone is ok.Primary camera is good, but doesn\\'t seems to be true 48 mp. If you\\'re a selfie lover then dont buy this phone, because the front camera is worst.Decent battery life, can lasts upto 1 and a half day with average use.Processor saw some improvements, asphalt 9 and call of duty is running alright but not smooth. 90 mhz screen is a pure lie by the samsung, the TFT display is poorly managed on the hardware. Fast charging is there. I am so glad to say you that phone was delivered at fully boxed and wrapped around phone.As I using phone, the battery performing above my expectations.Camera is taking stunning pictures as I wish.Fingerprint sensor are working good but not like other.Screen touch also as smooth as the velvet touch.Phone is working at awesome speedy. Mic Quality in video is extremely bad. Cannot explain how bad it is... I ordered 2 phones at my home... both of them have this same issue. Samsung needs to address this immediately. I don\\'t want to talk about other features as this is budget phones. But never seen such a bad quality from this or lower price range. Nothing extra ordinary about this phone. There are much better options in this price range.The battery is definitely good, and lasts more than a full day.However on the down side, the phone is very heavy, camera is ordinary and it feels sluggish to use. For this price, it is a good phone. Bit heavy but battery life is good so can\\'t complain there. Camera is okay.. not so great. If you are looking for a good camera then u might not want this phone. Rest it is a good phone. 3 months use review - no voice recording tool, no screen video capture tool, it\\'s usually available on any cheap phone. Samsung says these are available on higher end models, who is a snob?Given 3 stars overall just because of the plastic at the back, during the call it vibrates  cheap plastic casing otherwise phone works fine. Other phones cheaper than this have better casing but then.... got this ph @9999 in offer. the touch, sensor are really bad. especially face recognition, which never recognizes me.application opening, processor speed with min 5 applications and battery life are good Nice product from samsung . I purchased it a few weeks back from Amazon with nice offer and exchange offer . Phone is great for daily routine task . I am using banking with Knox security and never felt any disappointments regarding this.It is not for gaming purpose . It\\'s a value for  money ,good battery life , nice big screen , moderate camera for daily purpose.  Overall it\\'s 5 out of 5 from my side.I wold like to say thanks to Amazon to give a reliable service . It feels good in hand.Screen is not very impressive  as advertised.Battery life is good.Main Camera is average. Front camera is good.It is easily handling both my personal and work environments. I don\\'t see any lag.Over all, it is a very good purchase at this price.PS : not able to find a good back cover as most of the available ones are manufactured for galaxy A12. They fits to M12 but feels like not perfect. This phone is having all good features and it\\'s finger print reader and face recognizing is working super.Sound and battery  life is goodCamera superAnd all other phone feature are compare to 30k+ ir provided in thisA big thanks to Samsung...loving it. Display is HD+ with TFT panel but it doesn\\'t feel like TFT rather it feels IPS LCD HD+ panel! Good move Samsung! But other brands providing IPS LCD FHD+ 90hz in this 12k segment from Other brands! But initially it\\'s good. 1 month since I bought it, excellent all rounder. Great performance, fast, nice camera for d price.Battery is too good, easily lasts 2 days with medium usage.I don\\'t play games, so can\\'t comment on Game performance.Camera is not d best, but for this price, I didn\\'t expect much. Daylight pictures are really great. Video quality is also good. I liked the battery backup of the phone and performance is so far good as it is being used by my parents. BEST phone for parents. Takes 2 hours to go from 0-100%. And please don\\'t buy this phone if you are photogenic or require gaming efficiency Mobile is nice5 star in Battery Life5 star in other specs4 star in camera3.5 star in optimization.The optimization is bad due to OneUI. Samsung hasn\\'t made a good UI. It is not optimised. The camera is better,but it don\\'t have more modes while it\\'s competitor Redmi 9 Power have nice camera modes. This mobile is best in all types just the Camera and OneUI is not good I used in and really the feelings was great. It is smooth no hang or down occours. Storage and new camera facility was just good and little bit mora upgarde to the camera needed I think \\'Slow motion operation \\'. Over experience was great. You all have to try it once. For gamers it may little not good as the processor is getting some lapse while using heavy games.My experience was best because with this amount the mobile provides a lot. At this price, I expect atleast a little better phone. First of all, the processor is slow and lagging. The camera quality is very bad. I mean \"very\" bad so think about what are the essential things you definitely need before buying. Battery life is fine. Look is average because its quite thick than other models. Overall, I think its okay for general purposes but not a good phone to have. I bought the phone yesterday. There is a problem with the display and image quality view in this phone. Images appers yellowish and dull. I am thinking of returing the phone. I think this product is not bad. Those who don\\'t want to take a lot of selfi but want to use Phone for call, to listen music and to watch videos - they can try this M12 .Yes Phone looks slightly heavy but overall good in this price range I have purchased a samsung M12 mobile and 6 months free screen replacement warranty added for prime member at that I am also prime member so this benefit added.After 2 week mobile was Fall down and screen was damaged.So I went to samsung service center and claim the warranty but my mobile insurance plan was not activated so you will be bay and change the screen.Last 25 days I am try to activate my plan but problem was solved upto date.So please solve the problem quickly Bad in charging ( not a fast charging  phone take 4 to5 hours for charging)Also battery back is not good enough  drained in 8 hours similar as my earlier  phone .Screen display also not up to mark. ( pixels  are average)Sound quality  in both speakers is bad ( voice clarity  not good)Also phone is slow while operating ( taking pause while using)There are  good option other brands at similar  prices I always think 10times before I order anything expensive from Amazon because I have got a bad product. But this time dont know why I didn\\'t give a thought. This model of Samsung M12 was available in Amazon only and guess what I received manufacturing defective piece. Seems like Amazon is pleasing customers by making things available in advance which turn out to be defective. Samsung also does not take responsibility of replaceling their defective piece with a new one. There is a Bluetooth connectivity issue in Samsung M12 mobile and it also not supports 5G. Big drawback for this product. I never expected from Samsung that this type of issue will come with phone. I don\\'t know why bluetooth is not supporting to all device. Please provide the Bluetooth connectivity solutions. Haven\\'t used it for too long but from the current usage these are the observations1. Battery life is good,  used it to stream movies and music but still worked out fine.2. Camera is ok, again based on specs for the price range.3. Would have liked better packaging and a back cover atleast. Brought this phone in Apr 2021 , kept it for charging when the battery was down and after after hours the display was gone . Don’t suggest anyone to buy this phone . I\\'ve been using this for some days now and I have to say it\\'s been great. The phone is really sleek and screen resolution is very good. Camera is excellent in Good lighting... Under poor light or night time it may not do so well. Phone is really beautiful though. 6Gb,128 GB phone was much slow than my old phone of 2Gb, 32Gb.Don\\'t go by specifications only, performance not matching for this model.Thanks to Amazon for returning the product. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Gaming wise very poor Uhh...the fingerprint scanner is good but i am not a fan of side mounted fingerprint scanner....so thats why the 4 stars... otherwise, everything is fine looking at the price.... though the phone is a bit heavy and bulkier than my other phones. Overall it\\'s the best phone for the price range. Battery life is a blast, sometimes I can go without charging for 2 days on a 2-3 hour screen time. If you start the day at 100, after heavy use you will still be left with the battery at the end of the day.The camera is pretty good too, but not great. I\\'d say a 4/5 for the camera.The phone is kinda heavy if you are not used to heavy phones then take care for the first 1-2 weeks. At this cost, this phone is awesome. Camera, Screen, Battery everything is awesome. However, on careful inspection some sensors are missing when compared to Xiaomi and other Chinese brands. There is no option for WIFI 5.0 Ghz in this phone. Now-a-days almost all of us have dual band Wifi router in our homes/offices. But this phone will only work with lower speed and lower bandwidth 2.4 Ghz. It cannot detect the higher bandwidth 5.0 Ghz, so you won\\'t get higher Wifi speed Pros..Battery stays more than a day at a full recharge.. (Usage : medium)New sensors for motion gestures..Viewing angles nice.Camera - decentCons:Slightly thicker nd weigher..After two days it wasn\\'t noticeable...Verdict: Go for it.. Worst UI experience from samsung.1. Basic app lock setting missing.2. Data disconnected while in a call.3. While using Amazon custome care chat keyboard hide the typed content.4. SMS selects the recent caller option missing.5. You can\\'t off the alarm for one particular day. You have to off then on the alarm again.5. Unnecessary samsung apps occupy the space which you not even open in your lifetime. Since, my colleague is using this phone for the past 20 days, he is extremely satisfied with the product (be its battery life, camera quality or display). The thing which he miss is the Samsung Earphone/headphones which should have been provided with it (thus cutting one star for this). Else everything is okay. A phone working good with all app except high end gaming app or some high processor occupied apps. Phone get switched off automatically on high processor usage when multi app functioning. Good at 8.5k price.Camera quality very good without zoom. Very bad with full zoom. Same with selfi cam.Networking : zero problems till now.Rest is good till now in last 1 month from i bought. Good bettry life so mobile is bit heavy.Not a best camara but fine in this range and its not 48MP totally fake.Overall good for parents who needs bettry life and not photoholic. Fingerprint reader not worked properlyIf you unlock  you device 10 times its perfectly  work only 6 times*PHONE PAY* GOOGLE  PAY * NOT WORKING IN THIS DEVICE ,WHEN YOU ENTER  PASSWORD  ITS OVERLAPPED, YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE WHAT ARE YOU ENTEREDI PURCHASE M12 IN APPROX 25 SEPTEMBER  AND WITH IN 2 WEEKS PRICE DOWN BY 2000RS ,ITS SHOWS THAT PRODUCT IS TOTALLY  FLOPED NOW SAMSUNG  JUST CLEARED THE STOCK. Camera quality good but photo click krne me time bahut lagta.... what\\'s app pr 1 sath 2 camera photo send nhi hoti....10 photos send krni hai(camera wali) to 1 -1 krke hi send krni hogi...battery life super se uper....jb ko mere mobile me na to memory card na hi koi Jada phone data...Phil bhi camera slow.song full volume pr 1dm se high ho Jata hai jb ki 1 point km Kate hi sunai hi nhi deta I had purchased M31 and wanted to get a second phone, so got this.Latest OS , Good RAM and internal storage,disappointing  its released in Feb-2021, but didn\\'t provide a 5 ghz WLAN connectivity (my mistake based on M31 thought this will also be available based on release date), also the Network signal gets lost very often.Though it can be expanded to 1TB, would recommend spend an additional INR 4-5K and get M31.Couldn\\'t return. Very poor quality phone. Camera and display quality is very poor. Poor than even 2 mega pixels camera.Display quality is worsed . Totally use less product.Doesn\\'t meet any quality as advertised by samsung. .I don\\'t want to give even 1 star to this phone.This is worst product of samsung.I want to return this phone.Amazon please return this phone Complete package, truly it\\'s a Monster Reloaded. Everything from Camera to Speed to Interface is perfect. Only negative thing is that it\\'s bit thick & heavy. It\\'s a Made in India Product. Light weight, lovely colour.UI is good.Camera settings had to be changed as the default picture quality was set to 5MP. After a software update, I could change it to the right MP. 6 months screen replacement for prime means, third party is providing replacement for prime members only within a certain prime day offer period.In case anyone want replacement, have to contact or raise a request through for replacement. Third party will do the needful accordingly. Within six months its dead, never ever buy samsung mobile, sorry I never expected this from samsung, it\\'s rebooted again and again, all please avoid samsung they didn\\'t do R&D properly Their is no negative rating option, so i have to give 1 rating to this junk phone.  DON\\'T BUY this device, after 5 day only its screen become blank tried all possible trouble shooting available online, but this junk phone didn\\'t recover. Finally i have to go to service centre and from their also pathetic response i have to visit 3 different service centre to get this repair. Didn\\'t except such a pathetic product from Samsung. Nice product! I like it so much, battery life is too good I do not drain more the 50% of battery after heavy usage. Camera quality is good, processor is so amazing for day to day usage, fingerprint works pretty well, charing speed is normal. Overall, nice product for day to day usage. And thanks flipkart for so delivery very! I ordered it on 18/03/2021 and get it one 20/03/2021! Thanks flipkart again for fast delivery and a value for money and budget phone in only 11,000 rupees The fingerprint sensor is very fast... 90hz display quality is good smooth touch and nice colour production. Battery backup is awesome can play games specially PUBG in HD  easily without lag ,but the portrait sensor is not so impressive, it\\'s just somewhat good. 48mp and other lenses are also awesome ,they capture really impressive images....Overall the mobile is very good . If you have lower budget and about a trustworthy brand , then go for it. Even YouTube videos are running screen getting turned off automatically and sound goes normal. This problem is happening unevenly. I have used very gently as it new device and I facing this problem. Please don\\'t waste your money here .be careful with what you are getting 100% battery charging takes 3hrs of time were slow changing but the battery life is wow it\\'s super, camera quality is super it\\'s just been 3days if any other issues I will update my review in future. So impressed with the battery backup, and display is good with a great refresh rate, value for money product, that too in a great price. Using this phone along with my S21 Ultra,but still i love this. Battery backup super,Camera quality well... But the macro option worst... Selfi just low quality..Processing speed good...some specification are like to 6000rs mobile phone...Face lock, fingerprint lock are very quickly working...Overall it is monster... Best mobile Except WiFi network connectivity, others things are good.This phone & other company phone kept side by side for testing WiFi signal catch,,,,,,, other company phone WiFi signal connect very fast all time........... but this Samsung M12 failed maximum & maximum & maximum time to catch WiFi signalVery much disappointed with Samsung M12 ☹️☹️☹️☹️ Amazon didn\\'t allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.Heating problem. It doesn\\'t work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one. घण्टा true 48 megapixel कैमरा है !!!🔔🔔🔔🔔कैमरे की क्वालिटी 2G के समय जो चाइना फोन आते थे उसके 2 mp के जैसी है ।फोन में दमदार बैटरी के अलावा कुछ भी नही है ।इस प्राइस रेंज में दूसरे मोबाइल इससे ज्यादा फीचर और अच्छी क्वालिटी में मिल जाते है ।पता नही क्यो अमेज़ॉन कस्टमर रिव्यू में ज्यादातर लोगों ने 1 स्टार दिया है फिर भी अमेज़न इसको ओवरऑल 4.5 स्टार क्यो दिखाता है !! The mobile is good. When the users switches on the mobile for the first time. it finds it too hard to answer all the preloaded questions or confusions.I ordered the mobile , I am going to use the mobile and the additional apps choices should be mine. Numerous un-necessary additional apps are preloaded. I was forced to un-install all the additional apps that was preloaded un-necessarily. Very Horrible Camera , was totally disappointed with the camera , very poor camera and bad service by Amazon. which made my life miserable in exchanging this product. I have bought many mobiles earlier and now i will not buy from this site as exchange replacement is very difficult. Think twice before you buy the same. Redmi/Realme phones offers much better specs in this price bracket.Samsung mobile having Exynos processor is known for its lagging performance when compared with those having much lower spec SnapDragon processors. Here same case with M12 also.The only reason for which I recommend M12 is, It comes with Android 11 out of the box and latest One UI also it\\'s built quality. within 5 months of purchasing there is voice issues in mobile. Not able to hear talk from other side suddenly and need to switch off and on mobile frequently, after switching on the mobile there wont be any voice issues for couple of hours but again the issue will arise after some time, after restarting the device, again for some this issue will get resolved. Currently restarting the device min for 10 times in a day. Wonderful purchase. I got it for 9499. Amazing budget phone, camera is decent and touch sensitivity is good. Battery life is good but it starts to slow down with usage.There is not lagging yet. Fingerprint is prompt in action, but they need to work on the face unlock.If you have a normal usage, with no gaming, this phone is for you. Its a steal deal!!! The phone is good.Best for daily use, but if you will play heavy games you may face problem.Camera and built quality is also good.The main problem is with the delivery,The phone was broken and when I complained about it they said we can not do anything,Now I am using a broken phone without any of my fault.0 Star for Amazon!!!If you want to buy any product online don\\'t consider Amazon. It\\'s very prior to review because I got it one week before. But, I fully satisfied with Samsung galaxy M12. I am Very Happy for this purchase. This was value for money deal for me.  Thank you Amazon 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓Thank you Samsung 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓☺💗 Go for this if you want samsung brand and trust.Don\\'t waste your money on chinese phones, samsung nis far better than other brands..Also In this you will get One UI core version but samsung doing amazing job with it\\'s UI and implementation..Battery life is awesome..Recommended phone.. camera quality is very poor and we cannot watch videos in HD(1080) quality.. and upto the mark.. FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS REALLY GOOD IT READS AND UNLOCKS IN LESS THAN A SECOND AND THE PROCESSOR USED HERE IS AS EQUIVALENT TO SNAPDRAGON 662 , 660 SOMEWHEREIF YOU ARE PLAYING PUBG IT GIVES HD+HIGH ,SMOOTH + ULTRA ,OVERALL THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR DAILY USAGE AND GAMING BUT IT HAS A 8MP POOR FRONT CAMERA SENSOR IF YOU DONT USE YOUR CAMERA MUCH THIS PHONE IS FOR YOU ! Received the phone on time as promised. The battery backup is just fabulous - 6000 mAh definitely the power backup requirement that every phone needs. Easy to use phone, but some apps are pre loaded which can be deleted if not using. But definitely way ahead than all the other chinese brands. With 6Gb RAM, using the phone is as smooth as silk. I would recommend this phone with the 6GB / 128GB config to others. Samsung is really worst company.many time I unable to receive the phone calls.I will never buy Samsung phones anymore. I don\\'t know why they forcefully added their apps in the phone and you can\\'t remove them. I bought this mobile for my mothershe doesnt use much apps , mostly Youtube, insta, wastapp, music , facebook.Cant comment how this mobile performs for GamesOveral nice looking , robust mobile, good processor, camera is also good, charging last upto 2days normal usage Fingerprint scanner is too slowTouchscreen doesn\\'t respond 5/10 timesNeed to long press many times to get responseNetwork issue..This is review after using this phone for 5 days.Totally disappointed. Bought the Samsung M12. Good purchase. Worth the price.Likes:1. Exceptional Battery backup2. Fast processing for Game Play3. Good Display clarity4. Very responsive Biometric sensors, especially Face RecognitionNot so Good Camera clarity especially during night time in artifical light. Also, the speaker sound could have been louder. I bought the phone the 6GB ram version and have been using it for three days now. Tge functions are smooth and the camera and screesize are great for the prize. It also gets fully charged in an hour. Will review again after a few more days. Can accomodate 2 sim cards plus a sd card simultaneously. Also the finish as the back is textured and matte, not glossy like it seems in the pictures. If you expect to use WIFI in 5GHz band at home , then Dont go for it; it supports only 2.4 GHz.  Really disappointed after got to know this. it was not highlighted specifically in the retail sites, info is available in Samsung site only.You cant full enjoy an internet speed at home, even if you have 5GHz band router It is written that\"Whats in the box Handset, Ejection Pin, Manual, Data Cable and Travel Adaptor\"I received only Mobile, Data Cable & Adaptor there is no handset Ejection pin manual warranty card and proper bill It\\'s amazing!! It\\'s really a monster reloaded version...works amazingly! Even the Amazon service was nice....it was not damaged when delivered..I has all new features...and is very satisfactory..just how android users need.. camera is nice too..n specially the cover it has got...is very grippy...the phn doesn\\'t slip from hands😅 Grt product at this price, bank offer also applied.Camera rating 2 starDisplay 2 starBattery & Performance 5 star.Over all good product at this price. A sturdy phone with good battery and storage for rough and tough use. Camera is good with good quality front and back cameras. The 6.5\" dimension is very good for viewing videos. This at an affordable price makes it a paisa vasool mobile. I have bought this phone for my cousin, whenever he is editing videos or playing new indian version of pubg, phone is getting hang very much.Otherwise phone for normal use is good, not good for video editting and game lovers. Not much impressed with this product for this price.. Mobile is very bulky and fingerprint sensor is not much handy. Photo quality is just okay when I compare with redmi y3. Everything is very good som people said processor is not good but it\\'s absolutely very epic it can handle any task also I didn\\'t use it for gamingoyher than that video editing is great and battery can stand upto 2days if not use very hardly, it has a great battery , camera is fabulous also galaxy apps give u boost in every way hence this phone is very fabulous under 10K, Hence Proved. Camera Quality is great with good processing speed and classy features. Only limitation is with the 5 GHz wifi connection. It only connects to 2.4 GHz wifi network. sometimes it lags camera quality is very good but not excellent compared to other phones in 20-30k range despite it having 4 cameras and battery life is good but for a 6000mah battery it shouldve had more battery life and it lags sometimes when calling and stuff overall a good device for the price got it for 8.5k on amazon The mobile takes around 4 hours, and gets drained out in 2-3  hours (ONLY WiFi enable and NO GPS, NO Wif-Calling, NO Hotspot, NO Hotspot, NO Bluetooth) without any usage.Further, the Amazon replacement process is too lengthy and bad. You\\'ll have to go through a technician home visit in the process. M12 build is good. Handset is little bit heavy. Camera quality is 50:50. Battery life is awesome. With Android 11 browsing is faster. Fingerprint on right side works well. Phone is just okay similar to m30, m31s. However this phone misses to have dual band wifi. Supports only 2.5 Ghz wifi band limiting the wifi speed. Unable to make of 5Ghz wifi for higher speed. * good proc* not heating much* fast* good storage* not slow after 2 months of usage (with a lot of old / transferred data and apps)* value for money* good sound (not great, but good) Sab kuch bhandia hai bs ek chiz samsung ki joh shuru se khrb hai ki thoda sa 2 3 week me 1 bar hang ho jata hi 1 2 sec k lie. Baki agar mobile ki bat kre toh thoda bhari v hai or mota v hai ek bar offline chala k dhekh lo fir online khreed lo. very poor quality display The new samsung m12 is really amazing,Has a side fingerprint reader and battery quality is good.The product was delivered early with proper care.The display is good and samsung has introduced a few new quirks into the UIVery good phone for the budget. Battery  Performance  Long Lasting  But It Takes More Than Two & Half Hour To Complete Charge  So There  Is Nothing Like Fast Charging  (think self 15w charger for 6000mah battery) Camera Quality Poor As They Call It 48 Megapixel Camera But Actually It Don\\'t Take Proper Zooming Shots (more u can guess self) And Rest All Features Are Best As My Own Understanding For Such Budget . Real battery monster, good RAM & processor performance. At this budget, getting these 2 key features is a great deal. Camera quality may not be satisfactory but overall the phone is great. We cannot expect all top features at this price. Still the phone is a great product at this price. Good value for money. Bought it for my parents. Screen is large, so easy for them to use. However Samsung should think of making it lighter. Good build quality, good camera. The touch is awfully unresponsive..Ys without any protective glass, which fails as a touch device in the first place..in these days of loaded cameras, this is kind of ok. so is the battery. Samsung doesn\\'t promise much on display but the bothersome unresponsive touch is a big downfall which overrides everything else about the phone. Phone touch is smooth doesn\\'t hang and heat battery life is best and charges fast problem with this phone is camera quality they say it\\'s 48mp but it feels like 13mp fingerprint sensor onside is very inconvenient they must have placed it on the back and the phone is very heavy Worst product from Samsung ibreally did not expect this from samsung and I really had more expectations about this productMore over this phone says 90 hz display bit it hangs a lot and it\\'s like using a fake 3 class phone.I do not want the other customers to fall for the Advitisment of this device which is a total scam I would like to says people be careful and don\\'t be a victim to this phone Review Summary: I bought two Samsung phone and both have below cons. A21- Rs 18000, M12-10500Dislike: Charging Speed too low, Camera is very bad. Phone is quite slow as compared to other rivalary phone. Too heavy. In short Phone is very costly as compared to its features. Touch screen is also not so fast. Sometimes it doesnt work.Samsung seriously need to work on the above problems. Initially when I purchased I had a problem with it\\'s speaker after the instructions followed for fixing now the device is overheating while charging , also when I\\'m using for even small applications like Google meet its not even a heavy application like COD . I advise you to not buy this device it has so many issues like this, Worst experience ever and it\\'s only been a month since I have purchased it from Amazon. The worst mobile I have bought from samsung. I have been a premium samsung customer in past where I haven\\'t faced any issues. But for this model, by day 16 the display is not seen and I can\\'t replace the mobile even in Amazon and also in samsung. The battery is getting heated up. I suggest not to buy this model because I have an issue in camera which I have replaced and faced the above issue with the second buy. This phone was gifted by me and the user of the phone has the following complain. she is been using it for 15 days now.1.Sometime the dialing just stops and it hangs for a while.2. Sometime u cannot disconnect the call.3. In a span of 15 days the phone has hanged for 4 times4. I feel there is a software issue.5. there are few small problems while using the phone but cannot explain. Battery is pathetic.  It\\'s not 6000 mh battery. it drains very fast. Phone is ok for 10000 budget. Samsung quality has dropped.  Earlier Samsung phone had a superb quality.People buying this phone can go ahead. Good phone only battery  draining fast.I am using vivo y12. It\\'s 5000 mh battery  but it last more than M12. Samsung offered great features in this price range but the performance is not as it may seem. Back camera is good, but front camera image quality reminded of starting phone camera (blurry). Fingerprint reader does not work many times. Surprisingly this new phone also hangs sometimes. Still it is usable considering its price. You can consider MI to Samsung in this price range Good about product- battery  is superb- camera is Ok Ok not so good as expected from 48MP camera- easy to operateNegatives- processing is concern , very slow response of touch , even my three years led phone give better touch response- hindi typing is tedious process which must be easy like other phones- charging time is 3 hours so not so quick Phone is quite heavy in weight. Fingerprint sesnsor is fast. Camera quality is not as good as expected. UI is smooth. Back panel looks good. Battery is good. As the headphone jack is in the lower part of the panel, you can\\'t keep the phone in upright position when the headphone is plugged in. Loved this phone, especially battery life is amazing,  I can easily go without charging for 2 days. I m not a heavy user though I play CoD once a day and response is good, doesn\\'t lag at all. Happy with this buy, full value for money.Con: Camera could have been better, just that I have seen better photos with lesser specs Not bad for my needs as I\\'m not a PUBG fanboy... good for elderly people.. go for Galaxy F22(G80) or M21-2021(Exy9611) if you\\'re looking for a better gaming XP.. Camera suffers in low light but pretty solid in daylight.. Software is well optimised unlike Mi and Realme.. Quite a bit overpriced..Not Bad but certainly not the Best.. Galaxy F22 has better XP.. M03s has better Value Interior product with very bad quality body material. Not charging and battery is getting heating.Very much unsatisfied with Amazon to list such a bad quality product, selling no support being provided after sell.Also I loosed trust on Samsung. Hard to believe such big brand reputed company ditching customer by providing worst quality product. I bought this for my mother who uses for basic calls and youtube. Not for moderate or heavy users. It will be a good option if calls and little bit of social media are the only things you use on phone. Purchased the device 2 months back, Now Mobile Display was not showing and when shown to the service center they won\\'t cover the display under warrenty, they charged us for the display.Device display causing the issue because of high capacity battery and mobile heating issue This is an amazing product, the ram is really fast and it\\'s battery life is just amazing, I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this. The cameras are amazing and I\\'m super happy with the front camera as well. The scrolling feels so smooth and the wide screen is a good feature.  Overall I\\'m really happy with this, definitely an upgrade from my old Redmi Note 4! I used this mobile ofter 1 week iam giving reviewFinger print sensor is above 3 starScreen is above 3 starCharging and battery is well-done 5 starCamera is just ok above 2 starMobile  working just fine like 4 gb ram it\\'s not working like 6 gbAnd I will say finally go for another mobile it is only 4g mobile. Even 5g wifi is not connect this mobile genaration is going fast Phone seems looks good but getting stuck when we browsing, while using calls and using camera. So I recommend do not choose samsung at all. Go for better company where reasonable prices applicable. ✅ Solid build quality from Samsung as always. Feels bit premium due to the textured and smudge proof back panel.✅ Amazing display @4k 60fps 90Hz✅ Responsive side fingerprint sensor.✅ Average camera, but good in budget.✅ Made in SAMSUNG, Noida Plant, INDIA. Don\\'t have to worry about giving your hard earned money to CCP controlled companies. Product supplied was having damage. Images and videos arr not having clarity as them appeared to be blurred like negative film of old photograpphy. Black surface is appeared to be white and white appeared to be black. Even the images and videos downloaded from internet are found to be not visible and having no clarity. Also the photos taken in photone are having no visibility. So i placed return request. Not satisfied,as told in products reviews told at The time of saleNot a Fast changing as mentioned. Got heated while charging, product value questions your brand- Samsung. M12 series, Even not listed in your own brand list for exchange options, why it so? Camera is the best of all without a doubt. Device is very smooth and it can be used 2 days or more if you don\\'t use heavily.I am a heavy user with lots of phone calls and heavy using of youtube. Phone is heavy because of it\\'s massive 6000 mah battery. Every thing is fine if you don\\'t play heavy games we can play games under 400mb smoothly.Smooth device writing this after 2 months of usage loving it. 🔥😍 Writing this review after 2-3 months of using it. Phone is sturdy & battery life is superb.Finger print sensor & Face recognition needs improvement. Sound is excellent.Camera is as per the best quality. Camera quality is not as expected,  we can consider a low budget phone. Finger print reader doesnt works some times. Battery backup is great, built quality is nice. I have been facing issue of wifi connectivity post software updates. I have asked for replacement phone still same issue now waiting for refund.Not sure about issue of connectivity but i have faced on two similar phones model This budget mobile is very good. No heating, no hanging, no slacking. Fast browsing, sound is good.  Handling  very easy. batter back up very  high, finger print reader stylish & nice, camera quality  good. Never been a fan of Side finger print, so no points here. Battery life is definitely good. Camera and sound are both just average, nothing more. I\\'m sure, had i broadened my horizon, there are better products to choose from in this price range. Samsung M12 mobile is excellent for low budget. Camera, Battery Backup, Display & Sound quality is too much good. So I recommend to all viewers go & purchase this mobile without any doubt & hesitation. Thanks  Samsung to bring this product for middle class peoples. My choice is all to use Samsung because it\\'s operating system is very easy to any user.Regards,Khilaban Kumar Das The mobile lacks in some of the basic features. Screen capture is a problem and other gunctionalities. You can\\'t set a clock as screen saver. I feel the basic features that doesn\\'t involve costs should be made available Samsung is providing better phone now but this m12 is less than average. Average display, average battery and charging. U can buy it for your father or mother, means who don\\'t use it more would love to buy it. Bought it as my talking device because of its huge battery capacity. It is a secondary device and I love it. If you’re looking for a simple device at best price I would surely recommend it. Very good phone with a nice battery. The camera quality is up to the mark According to the price. The fingerprint sensor also works very Smoothly. The display is also good but you can\\'t really find the difference from 60hz to 90hz. Although the phone is good for its price but in the box you  don\\'t get a cover, pre applied screen protector and a short USB cable. Awesome mobile in this price segment. Battery is big for 1 1/2 day. Rear camera is also good. In this range.. 8nm processor & with thebrand of Samsung... Ossummm.. after 3 months of use this product i recommend u all that buy it if u want mobile phone in this range.. network speed is also bestest because of 8nm processor.. all the best Camera quality is below par than the 12MP old phones. Poor Customer service. No call recórding option, No ultra power saving mode. Never buy Samsung phones it\\'s last its quality. Attached photos for reference. Samsung blaming Amazon saying they provided the defect piece to me. Efficient authorised service provider finding is also headache in this pandemic situation. BETTER NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. No any help option on Amazon for warranty replacement display. If 6 month screen replacement warranty from amazon side so how is the process.bcz no any replacement option.no any contect number amazon customer care for help..very bad service.6 month warranty only provide from amazon.no warranty from samsung.samsung service center told give me 3600 RS for  display replacement charges. So what I do.. I got the product seems used by some one, there are finger print in the mobile phone screen, also the bill found in two piece, already tored by someone The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good packaging, delivery and excellent phone. The phone has a very good battery life and the camera is very good and takes excellent photos. It\\'s a decent phone very fit for this price range. It\\'s worth buying, worth the price. Taught this phone is really very good and purchased face tec issue net work was not at  all capturing completely phone was very sloe compare to my previous one... Tec guy visited finally noting happned because phone had issue and got a replacement for new 1but was surprised beacuse the second 1is worster then before... Am really very upset almost 2weeks without a a phone is not at all acceptable Very good purchase.Excellent battery life better than Galaxy 31s model.All the features are good except camera.Very happy with the purchase of this phone. Perfect value phone. Has everything that one requires. For the price it is more than value It is a little heavy compares to others but not a deal breaker.. perfect for gifting to parents... There is a software problem, whenever you make a call for the 1st time the speaker is not activated and so you can\\'t hear anything the person on the other side is speaking. But if you disconnect it and call again it works fine. Initially i thought its network issue but later i realised it happens every time i try to make i call after a considerable time gap like an hour or so. I got this for 11,499 which was a great deal for 6gb ram and 128 gb memory. Phone camera is not worth the quality mentioned and the device is also having more weight... Rethink if you want to buy this... Not sure why amazon removed return policy it\\'s better to check phone locally in shop and buy I don\\'t use mobile for heavy-duty stuff.From my regular use for a month now I can tell that there have been No hangs. Hence a great improvement over my previous phone back is non-slippery and hence fewer chances of mobile damage, pretty good for clumsy guy like me Wonderful phone for the provided price. This was bought for my father .I was using one plus 7 pro and due to repair I was forced to use this phone for a week and to be honest other than camera I was more than satisfied with this mobile and its performance Camera quality is not at par. Samsung also doing as china. Shown 48 megapixel camera, but in-fact it may lower than 5 megapixel only.Samsung have to do something Very wrost experience this time.Touch is not working sometime.geasture is not working sometime.camara taking too much time to saving image after taking picture.mic problem when you make video call. Phone auto restarts at times.. touch capabilities are not that great, everything you have to ensure that your hands are completely dry. Even with a minute moisture on your fingers, phone gives you improper response Speed is OK for working, since it is 6 GB RAM. Battery is very good. Display is  also, OK. For doing normal data processing work lime share trading, for using excel, Word.., small types of editing,  ...., this system is enough, but if you intend shooting , its not enough.  Camera is not seems 48 MP. Front camera is OK. It\\'s amazing product from samsung.i congrats to Samsung engineer but one mild issues affect this mobile heat issue at the same it is not continue otherwise only charging time it might be heat slightly.Very low budgetCamera okTouch okModel okUsing very comfortableBattery heating is slightly negative so I give four 🌟 and with out battery issue I give 5 🌟 Most disappointing thing is it\\'s camera quality.It\\'s 48mp camalera is not worthy. It does not match with Nokia\\'s 13 MP camera.I purchase it for camera purpose but it does not fulfill my requirement. Camera quality is very poor.Though display is quite decent, battery life is normal functioning is smooth.If you are looking a mobile phone for camera then never buy it. Samsung really needs to stop fooling customers with its marketing and needs to improve its products to compete other brands. This new samsung m12 is a piece of crap and wastage of money. The sound is too low. If the phone is ringing, you can\\'t hear even if you are sitting next to it. The design is okay. No new or nothing very impressive. Copied the F12 in terms of design screen broken. amazon claims that there is one time free screen replacement warrantee for Prime. i am not able to claim warrantee. product support section of amazon is not working. + PointsGood Budget Phone.Good DisplayGood Outlook- PointsToo heavy, due to big battery.The camera is not that effective.Takes longer to charge Fingerprint senser is not so sensitive. One has to put his/her finger very tightly.Battery charges slow since it supports 15 watt charger. It drains faster if adaptive motion is set to 90 hz.Camera quality is decent but it should be improved. In 48 mp mode flash will not work.It\\'s backlight remains always on due to which processor is heated.Speakers are very slow. After gaining experience by using it at least 3 months then correct answer will come. How can I give 5 out of 5 within a month. Thanks for your cooperation. I already have one Samsung M20. After buying this new M12, I installed Samsung smart switch on both phones. It  transferred all data except messages in thousands. I raised request with Samsung. They clarified it is software bug and update would be provided within 24 Hrs. It\\'s third day, no update is received. I am returning new M12 phone. Like the Samsung brand experience but it\\'s motherboard failure within 2 months disappointed. Battery life is good lasting for 2 full days! More bulky n weight. Brought this mobile on March 30. I am not satisfied with this mobile. It\\'s getting heat when we use it for the normal phone calls without internet as well. When i checked with Samsung service center they said that if the mobile heat goes beyond 48°C then they can look into it. Not sure who will be able to withstand this mobile heat when they are talking. Pls don\\'t buy. I am using this product since last 1 month. The display is nice..... HD+ display but colour contrast is amazing. The battery last upto 36 hours with normal use.Camera is good for captureing pictures day light. It\\'s 90hz disply is awsome.This smartphone is NOT FOR GAMING.There is slight lag while using heavy apps.Otherwise it\\'s a good budget phone........... 👍👍 I am the user  of only Samsung.  Compared to other models that I have been using till date , this model doesn\\'t satisfy me. The signal strength is low compared to other brands in this price and specifications.Overall I am not satisfied with this model. seems a seconds phone like factory reject or a repaired version like refurbished maybe,it\\'s bent,the screen can\\'t be covered with tempered glass as the phone is curved. a good phone at this cost.fingerprint and face lock works perfectly fine.camera is also good in this cost(do not expect stability).there is no lag while using.The best part is battery, if you are not a heavy end user then you even need not see the battery for even 2 days, once it is fully charged.the worst part is display, very poor visibility in daylight. The phone built quality seems good. The weight is a little more than expected. Battery life and camara is good. Latest version of Android is also provided. Better finger print reader was expected. Bigger size scanner on back would be better. New fingerprint reader is awesome with nice ergonomics. Battery life no complains because of bed processor technology. Camera quality is ok ok at this price. Totally unsatisfied with the PLS TFT display and heavyweight.PLS TFT screen is low quality couldn\\'t enjoy video steaming. If you are in habit of watching a movie and playing gaming then you can search for other better mobile,Now both Amazon and Samsung refused to accept return or provide me replacement of better quality display (i.e, Amoled, IPS Display). Obviously battery is 6000 maH the phone is very heavy and feels like a brick in hand.The battery life is not that great but satisfied as a non gaming phone.Don\\'t buy this if you are looking for a phone with good performance during playing games. This phone is good only for daily use and you can gift your parents or elders who are not into gaming or desire high performance. Worst samsung phne ever. Its heavy. display is so not smooth have to like press each button atleast thrice. Cant ans calls on time as it kips hangin. Its not even a month since i purchased.  Camera is average. After using the phone for 45 days ,it looks good to use with low refresh rate and good battery backup, decent camera . Phone little bit heavy due to heavy battery and Wifi 5g band wont support in this phone.Also can use dual 4g sim at a time. Don\\'t buy this phone, it has some technical issues The phone is best buy, in terms of pricing and features. I guess this is the best option if someone is looking for a good Samsung phone at a proper budget First of all, this mobile will not work like 4 GB ram mobile. it has touch issue and it hangs very much . even if you do not have any thing in your mobile still it hangs while using youtube.do not purchase blindly by seeing attractive price then you suffer a lot. there is no return policy. Very nice phone .but it very much heavy than compare to other phones.you can\\'t carry in your pocket while woking. If you are field worker I suggest don\\'t buy . This is worst product from Samsung.  Under 10k we can move to vivo, oppo, or redmi brands wisely.  Camera quality is very very poor.  After taking photo we see broken pixels and the worst picture.  48MP true camera is only for mouth speech really it is very worst one.  Mobile become heat while charging alone.  Very much disappointed.  Not worthy for money.  Don\\'t buy this product. Pathetic phone .Battery good.Camera poor.Performance very poor, very slow.When you cut a call than notification of call ended arrivez and stays there for 5 minutes. You can not see complete keyboard while using other app. Absolutely pathetic.Charger very very poor.Screen poor.Sound poor.Overall below average phone in 10k price. Bakwas camera .. picture  quality  bohoth hi kharab hai.. 48mp camera  lagta hi nahi hai.. aur front camera  toh wahiyaad hai.. 2mp camera  jaisa pics ata hai... but battery  back up achha hai.. looks  bhi thikh thakh hai... yeh phone  uncle  aunty ke liya bana hai.. young  kisi ko pasad nahi ane wala hai.. I really liked the mobile, look and feel is goodBattery as committed last long, camera clarity is okay, one of the best I used as per Samsung. Charger says it\\'s fast charging it\\'s fake, it takes more than 2 hrs to get 100% charged. Fingerprint is not good, I struggle everytime. Waste product. Both amazon and Samsung cheated us. Worst camera. Mobile is too heating while charging. If long time on a call when also mobile get more heating. Finally the most worst experience is Amazon did not retake the mobile when we give request for return. The return policy is very worst. So please no one but this waste mobile The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Samsung gives us a great 👍product in this price range.1. Fast Fingerprint sensor.2. Good  Design.3. Battery 🔋performance is superb.4. Display quality 👌Awesome .5. Software performance is great. One UI is best. No Hangs or LagsOverall it full fill all  daily needs.Buy samsung . Samsung is Superb. Dislike....not supporting other applications like WhatsApp,  Facebook,  trucaller,  Microsoft teams...going to automatically switch off & vanishing above applications.  Want to try replace or return. But there is no option. I will not purchase any electronics products through online. Very slow phone, don\\'t buy it,,,i\\'ve been using it since 3 months,,but my experience with this phone is very bed,,,it is useless. Makes me irritate while using it due to slow response,,,, please think thrice before buy it,,,i have used phone with same configuration, but really it is comparatively too too too much slow. Have given 5 star if I would have got fully satisfied with Display.. I purchased this for my mother in law and found is good..camera : Good -As expected..Design : Good enoughDisplay : Is not Amoled. so you will not get that feel which We get with other Samsung product. But overall nice.. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I use this phone last 3 days.I happy last 3 days camera quality is good ,battery  life is good ,built quality  is awesome.This price point  value  for  money.One point company not providing, back cover, screen guardsOver all 10 out of 8 Battery: The battery backup is not longing even for half daySoftware: the app icoi is disappearing very oftenCamera: looks like 5 mp camera The phone was fantastic .......On a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it 9 ......The thing that I didn\\'t like about this is that it has very less storage ........Otherwise very good  MUST BUY I am using this phone from two days. I have exchanged my redmi 4 with m12. But after two days of usage, I found that this phone is not fast as redmi 4. I read reviews and got into dilemma when got mixed reviews.But according to me, its worth a buy.All functions i found good with a good screen size.The only con felt was that it was a little heavy for the pocket. Thats some competition in the budget phone market, the device looks sturdy,,, overall good, good display and battery.... Looks like i don\\'t need a new phone for 3-4 year anymore.... Charging point in mobile is not working and as this one is my second mobile I started it bit late and return period is over, this one is made in  India Samsung Mobile. Battery charging is fast and consumes less power. The only drawback is mirroring/casting of videos is not satisfactory  as videos on TV appeared  staggering. Impressed by Delivery, delivered within 4 days. Delivery boy was humble. I ordered this phone for my Friend who was using Redmi 4A since 2017, I was worried for it\\'s TFT LCD panel as it is not as good as IPS LCD, but amazed with its screen quality. Screen quality is justified for its price (I got it in 8.5k in Festive offer) and brand value and Viewing angles are acceptable. Overall ok experience, no cons. Getting a mobile with such configuration that too from a brand like Samsung, you can’t expect more. If your budget is fix and looking for made in India phone, go for it. Terrible Quality - Substandard Product - 3rd world Quality.. Cheating the INDIAN Customer..Want to RETURN My Product which I hardy used for 8days... Missed the Amazon Return policy due to Diwali Holiday Gift.DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG Phones - #BOYCOTTSAMSUNGMOBILE Awesome phone..Value for money..I gifted this phone to my wife and I can see the happiness on her face..Very good camera both front and rear.. with good memory.. Samsung never dissapointed me. The mobile at the price of 10999/- is a steal deal. The 6000mAh battery is a power house with excellent backup. The 48 MP camera is capturing good pictures. Display is quite good. I am totally satisfied with the phone. I like it face unlock working faster and fingerprint sensor also work faster not hanging problem and also the camera is outstanding I order this mobile was come a 31st November There\\'s a dent on my brand new Samsung Galaxy M12 I called customer care for the first time and they told me we would change your phone and Then second time they told me we would return your money Phone and box look like it’s used and old Phone display looks very dull, no setting to take pics in 48 mp. Photos came with low resolution when shot with camera. Not worthy to buy this model at this price. Camera is not at all 48mp. It is a worthy mobile.Con\\'s.Samsung provided normal travel adapter for charging. Which it take almost 2-3 hours to get full.Front camera is not that much good. I disappointed with this.Trasperant case is not provided. For other mobile every one will provide. Samsung is not providing this. I have 2 Airtel connected phone one in samsung M12 and another in realme. I need to keep samsung phone in balcony to catch network but realme works fine in every corner of house. GPS is pathetic, it keeps saying GPS signal lost when you drive on a new route using GPS Like : Look is nice, camera is good, user friendlyDislike : Wifi 5g not available, performance is not really good for 6gb ram, quite heavy to carry.Good for the cost but disappointed on the network. On seeing it\\'s features I bought this in exchange offer. It is not upto the mark. Processor is very slow. Weight is also high 221gm. Performing slow. Got delivered todayAfter 5 hours of usage+veGood screen but not the best(can’t complain for the price paid)Camera is better , some snaps taken were good.Battery stays for long . After 5 hours of usage the drain was minimal. So huge thumbs up-veToo much  unwanted apps came preinstalledOverall a total paisa vasool phone After i bought this item it is delivered within time. But i found its screen, display and touch screen is not working.Now i am struggling for replacement or refund of this purchase.Very pathetic product samsung prepared. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Nice product please buy it . Thanks for Amazon. Looking smart phone osm . Display vary nice . finger print is osm battery life is long life. Quality is osM. Camera is not upto the mark. 48MP camera feels like 5MP. Processer is bit slow while using many applications. Samsung still lags in budget segment smartphones. This phone has amazing specs, awesome battery life, mind blowing ram and processor, but I feel disappointed with the sensors. The phone lacks gyro sensor. You can\\'t even play games on this phone. Forget games, the simple compass app will not work as the phone cannot sense rotation vectors. Therefore it\\'s a toothless tiger. Pros:1. Price, especially during sale days clubbed with Credit card offers.2. Android 113. Smooth4. Camera5. Battery lifeCons1. Heavyweight2. Display (to some extent)3. Face recognition4. Placement of finger print sensor Superb..... Great speed.... and photos clarity. Loving ...... Battery last 100% charge, using since 2 days... Yet at 23% . Banking , payment security 👍. Camera 😘🥳, Speed ❤️❤️, All quality of phone , as name Samsung is Enough 👍❤️❤️❤️. Brand is Brand. Price range 👍🥰🥰. Finger print sensor 💪🏃⛷️⛷️⛷️superb. I will rate phone for this price range 95 The ear piece volume and the speaker volume is horrible and below par. Instead go for Mi A2 that mobile both ear piece volume and speaker output is far better Received a product with some small dent/mark on edge... That\\'s not expected from AmazonJust opened the product and started using... Been a day... Battery did not sustain a day despite charging 100%. Battery 🔋 googDisplay resolution good 90hzCamera 📷 not so good as 48 mpHeavy not so slimPerformance is good in normal use don\\'t play game like pubg,CODHeating issue is normalCharging time is soo long I bought it because I didn\\'t want to buy a Chinese phone for obvious reasons.It works smooth enough.But buy a protective screen guard which has oleophobic coating as the original display sucks.Overall it is a nice phone which I bought for my mother.Easy to customize things like fix the alignment of icons on home screen and hide unwanted apps. I gifted this phone to my mom, unfortunately she couldn\\'t do complete check of the phone within the days for return policies, we realised it a week later than this phones speaker has major problem. While on speaker and in horizon mode opposite person wil not be able to hear. Tried to get the replacement but no luck by Amazon team. A bit disappointed This device is awesome if u get it under 10,000.I got it @9,998.There is a miner lag in UI and it gets heat up (not quickly)if u use it for gaming.Camera is outstandingDisplay is goodSound is goodLooks is goodProcesser is avg(as we know😑)And last not the least - Battery is like a big MONSTER.Lasts upto 2.5 days . Display is worse. Very much unlike Samsung. I thought the first product had some display issues so I returned and got another one. But display itself is made like that Pathetic experience  with Samsung.Really samsung is zero in Android...I will not recommend any one to buy the Samsung brand phones ....It\\'s a wastage of money 💰....I have brought 3 phones of Samsung brand,and in all phones there is hanging ,phone heating ,net slow 🐌 and bugs issue .  frequently CAMERA APP IS POOR. I INSTALL OTHER CAMERA APP.PHONE IS SLOW.BETTRY IS GOOD.ADVANCE LOCK OPTION IS BED.USE FINGERPRINT OPTION. Nothing so important in this mobile. No need to buy if you having a mobile to use. Get some other make or model.Not a poor Battery. Laggy in use if two apps are open.Every time it self on Location without permission by default program In budget segment it is amazing phone with good camera ,remarkable battery and OneUi has no comparison in software and by look it look smart only issue is it is slightly bulky and think but monster battery in mind it is good phone ,if anyone purchase this phone it will not drawback for him/her This is the best smartphone in budget smartphones. The camera quality and clarity of samsung m12 is very good. Battery life 6000mh isvery powerfull it will stand for long life. Fingerprint reader is also good, it will give fingerprint reader at power button which gives it classy and unique look. Overall it is outstanding smartphone in low budget. I like this phoneI m using this phone and no issues in this  phone.Some people are saying  hang phone.But it is no hang and I love It performance Camera quality does not meet the standard as described in features. Being 48 mega pixel camera does not click good quality pictures also the colours of camera clicked pics are very dull. Front camera is of worst quality. I have samsung a50, comparing the camera quality this M12 is dull and poor inspite this being quad camera setup. Only this battery life is good. And provided the budget can\\'t complain much. But still there are many good camera quality smart phones available in this range. Advice you all to check in person and then order the device Main cause is lcd screen in this costOther brand give very much better options. I had very bad experience with Samsung M12. Why Samsung has made this with lcd Very dissapointed product.Not value for Money.If it is for rs.8000 it is OK.Only positive feedback is Battery backup.Camera- Not good front and rear.Finger print- Not comfirtable.NO default call recording option.If you having tru call then we can recordLittle more weght compared to other smart phone. And having hang for some times. one main lacking of samsung is not using the lens manufactured by SONY carl zeiss Phone is great !!! Great display quality rich colors smooth display interfaceCamera quality was not up to markGreat budget phone for normal user 👍👍👍 In photo looks so slip but it\\'s fat and dose not looks good . And the display quality is just hd that i just seen every pixels . Don\\'t go for this . Finger print reader is moderate. Battery life is good. Rear Camera doesn\\'t look like 48mp This phone is a budget  phone  which  will help with long 1 and half day  battery life with always full brightness, location and data on .  Camera is  good  on pro mode  but cannot  be compared  with  high  pixel phones.  6 GB ram is enough  for play  games. This phone has enough  fps for games like  pubg, asphalt  games  no lag. This phone is not original, camera quality is very poor its written 48Mp but even the picture quality is less than 10MP, always heating and very slow, Then we registered the complaint, service appointment was yesterdy no one came for service and also we received Mail service is done, Very very bad service and we dont know where should contact. Camera quality is blur and sometimes this phone hang without any reason I don\\'t know why this phone hang when RAM is 6 gb and 8 nano meter processor.Display quality is also not up to mark as we see in samsung phones what you are giving in this phone samsung if don\\'t have buget for this type  phone they why you promoting mid buget phones. Weight is heavy other than that it is worth the money , but since battery is big and works very long it is heavy . Little slow at opening the apps, sometimes apps lag, but i hope it will work for long time . You dont need to worry about charging the phone often, once fully charged even if used continuously it stands for one day. The stuff is too good and it\\'s working so well. It\\'s fingerprint senser is so good specially the camera bit there is one problem I dislike about it that it\\'s battery backup is so poor and the battery Neel down so fast and also one thing there is limited fonts in this device for using it freely....but all over this device so good and I appreciate this product SAMSUNG GALAXY M12 is not responding properly. (1) Suddenly switch off while on call (2) Most of the times ring tone will not come. (3) During transactions, the numbers in the key pad appear only half. (4) While calling, it will take too much time to connect (5) During work, suddenly goes back to home screen etc.Will u please replace the product? Don\\'t BuyWorest mobile ever by SamsungI am Samsung user only.. otherwise we can get better mobile of other brands.. I want only Samsung brand. But this time it\\'s totally waste of money.I am not happy with this model.. NO CAMERA Clearity..Heating problemCamera ProblemDisplay Third classDO NOT BUY ये सैमसंग का 5G का अच्छा मोबाइल है। मैं पहले सैमसंग का On 5 यूज करता था फिर सैमसंग का J7 max यूज किया अब ये M42 5G 8GB 128GB वाला मोबाइल यूज कर रहा हूं ।अभी तक मुझे सैमसंग के मोबाइल में कोई प्रोब्लम नही दिखाई दीआप भी ये 5G mobile ले अच्छी कीमत में बेस्ट 5G mobile है। मैं ने m12 भी घर के लिए लिया ये भी अच्छा मोबाइल है।धन्यवाद Its grip is great.you dont need a cover to avoid fall.cameras are great. Its a feast to take any kind of pictures with numerous options.Screen size is just right for watching videos and reading ebooks.Quick accezsbiljty options to lock unlock screen is very handy.Memory is big.dont have to worry about cleaning up space often Only who want big battery with fast charging can go with it.Pros: Awesome battery lifeFast chargingSpeaker is loud and crystal clearLike the placement of figure print senserCons: Pathetic camera output is not even 8 megapixel levelToo heavy and bulkyDisplay is average One drop within 1ft height ... Screen shattered ... Though phone spec & display is good ... screen is not at all durable. Same screen shatter issue in M31 as well. Great phone, my son is using this phone for some time now. Overall happy with performance. Only thing that is missed is 5 ghtz wifi capability. Also a little heavy in wt. But otherwise a great phone. Little bulky  in hand after  putting case cover I felt little  heavy  in hand  otherwise  all performance  and quality  is very good and decent mobile  to buy... Dislike,  Camera and battery is not as expected, remaining is as usual. No change .I think  samsung should stopped making phoneOr either samsung is now developing fake product andWe r paying hard core money to buy this brand.Battery starts  from 84 percent and within 5 hours it become 20 percent in normal use mode. High speed, Hi quality camera & speakers, latest features All the features are good v nice camera, value for money but the only problem is that the phone is little heavy and after putting a back cover it becomes more heavy, rest it\\'s superb product from samsung 👌👍 As we know Samsung is a leading worth brand. I bought this mobile 2 months before. Up to today it is working well. Cemera accessiblty should be improve. Un necessary apps and ads showing. But quality is good. Pros.Good battery backupGood quality cameraFast response of finger printCons.Little bit bulkyPhone take few second after restartSome time shutter pop up automatically Best pick in this price range, if you want quality and brand trust, just go for it.Only this I did not like about this is camera quality could be better, other than that everything is great with this product. If you are looking budget samsung phone with great battery life and if you your hands can hold 1/4 kg weight (LoL) then go for it. Keeping in mind that camera 📸 quality average so don\\'t expect much. Display is great with 90hz refresh rate gives you better screen experience. Justifies the reviews in Google.Satisfactory performanceGood battery lifeGood quality sound in music and also in talking I am using this as my main phone and it is nice. The fingerprint reader... I don\\'t like it because sometimes I accidentally put my thumb on it and it unlocks my phone. The camera is nice and I like that I can edit the portrait photos after taking them.I will update this review after a month of use. Writing this review after using three weeks...Samsung introduced superb model, quite heavy.... battery life superb... finger sensor work exllent but not true HD display....camera is average...but okay...for simple users it excellent and also recommend for rough users.....all over it is value for money... I think this is the perfect and wonderful product.the SAMSUNG brand is always doing ultimate and it\\'s quality is so good..and massive battery long last ever and I like it very much.awesome camera and awesome display. Quick reading fingerprint sensor.and totally a good functiong awesome product.proud to buy this product and always buy samsung product.... Nice phone... good  looks , good display , good picture quality , good screen , better grip, very nice back camera, speed is good , finger print and face unlock is very fast ,  but the front camera is  ok  not upto the mark . OVERALL product is good at this range but front camera in little bit  disappointment. Humongous phone, good battery life and very good display. The phone is reasonably fast and unlock works swiftly. Its a beautiful buy in this price range and million times better than chinese trash. I dont have any concerns yet. Awesome phone. Amazing Battery backup, Charge it to 100% and even after usage and travelling it stays to 80% till evening. Camera quality also good enough, depth sensors help in focus, captures well in darkness as well, selfie wide angle is useful. Fingerprint sensor is good, voice and microphone good too. Performance is smooth. a phone worth of money. Phone is hanging and touch screen not working even after many taps goes on change other button not that which I have tapped want to return 6GB ram with 128GB memory makes this phone best in class at these rates. Battery of 6000mah also gives it the most numbers with the brand name of Samsung. This is really unbeatable phone in its class. Worst  phone  we can\\'t  expect  😪 this  kind  product  they  given  4 cameras  in that  one not at provide  anything  🙄 speaker we can\\'t  hear  anything  in it , photo  we can\\'t  focus  we believed in Samsung company they didn\\'t respect our expectations Camera average, bit disappointingUi greatUnnecessary apps too manyAds, manageable if while set-up the check boxes are ticked correctlyBattery superb, large 6000 mah battery paired with 8nm soc.Build goodDisplay average, but as expected, so no issues there.Bit thick and heavy though due to obvious reasons. But weight managed well. Only battery back up is good. Camera quality poor and touch quality is also very poor.  Only price and battery is good, rest all are less than average. Fingerprint and battery excellent, software upto the mark, processor enough for parents and online teaching-learning stuff,display above par, 90hz feel hota hai(but not like Amoled ones), Gyro not present.Clearly this phone is for internet surfing and moderate gaming and all. Perfect gift for parents. Pro:Under 15kLong lasting battery lifeSuper display qualityCons:Heavy weightBad camera clarity Very nice phone for such a price.No other phone can be so good in this price.So Greatat for so low price with SAMSUNG Branding 😍 Fingerprints reader sides bottom so not good battery backup excellent and back camera good quality but face cameras not expect good quality images and video Bakwas phone h kehne ko 6 gb ram h pr kissi km ki nhi or naya phone bhi koi or phone lene k liye replacement m M12 show hi nhi kr rha iska mtlb aap hi soche lo kaisa h sare phone k naam a rhe h M11 tk ka a rha h pr M12 ka kahi show nhi ho rha amazon p Processing is slow. Battery charging very slow. Screen touch response is also delayed. No doubt battery is awesome.Camera quality also upto mark.No complaints.Handset response slight slower as compared to other brands with same specifications.Recommended for low budget seekers with good specifications  specially battery purpose. Nice phone in this range. Back camera is superb front camera is just okay as it has only 8mp.What is the purpose of 4 camera only one camera is functioning other three even when we close no change is occurring. Good product for this range.  The processor was really good. Camera quality was good. Overall performance of this phone was great 👍.  If you don\\'t want a gamming phone for playing games, then you can buy it for your self or others. Paclaging was poor.Mobile built quality is average but good battery backup.Camera performace is good.Fingerprint sensor performance is not good, not so perfect and fast. If you are having tight budget,then definitely go for it.U will never regret for this..All good as per price point. U can say little bit more received at this price point.. I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and found this to be very heavy in terms of its weight.Additionally, the camera quality is not so good. The battery also lasts for a day with almost 1 hour of talk time.According to me, it\\'s not a good value for money.I was expecting a better camera quality and battery backup. The phone hangs sometimes while switching between apps. Otherwise it is good. Good for light usage. Battery is phenomenal! It has no heating issues.Camera is not as good as aspected, but works fairly well.Screen resolution  is not as good as expected.Screenshot gesture on phone is not available.Overall it is okayish. I liked everything of the handset,the look,the feel of handse8t in my hands, the voice quality,the camera function ,the battery life and the screen size,everything is perfect for this handset. First......STPL Exclusive online done a great job .....I got a fresh handset from them (phone manufactured in this current month).....and also seal was not broken......it\\'s totally fresh , untouched,  unopened ............best phone at this price , Knox security + amoled like screen + nice camera +best battery backup THE PRODUCT NOT SUPPORT THE  COMPASS ,NO SHORTCUT SCREENSHOT,IF WE TAKE A SCREENSHOT WE HAVE TO STRONGLY PRESS BOTH BUTTONS(ON OFF AND VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS) HEAVY PHONE HANGING SOME TIMES.SIM TRAY NOT EXACTLY FIT TO SIMS,SPL FEATURES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THIS SAMSUNG M12 MOBILE , WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN REDMI PHONES Good ... Happy with feature in this budget phone. Gifted this phone to my sister who often forget charging device so this one is working pretty well for her I love the quality samsung has packed in the phone at this price range. And everything in this phone is really like a monster. It\\'s camera are just awesome and speaker is not so much loud but has awesome sound quality. From my point of view I recommend to buy this phone I\\'d you want a budget phone under this price segment. Really a lovely phone. FIRST  FEW WEEK  PHONE  WAS  RUNNING  GREAT  ,  ON  03RD WEEK  \" camera light sensor \" draining  phone  battery too early  ,is there  any one  plz tell me  how  can i get  rid  from this  horrible problem , or  my hard earned money is just wasted Amazing phone. Budget phone. Features awesome. Using 2 month. Its wonderful. Camera quality is awesome. Special wide angle 122° camera. Battery performance too good. Dolby Atmos sound feature is tha main point. Feel like theatre. Speacially Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds Pro comparable. i have earbuds.Guys please go on this phone. Amaizing phone. This phone is reasonably good for the reason that price tag and features are incomparable at all. Excellent finger print reader that pushes the gadget to the nexgen range. As a lay user I can say that the camera is not that impressive as the one expects in 48MP camera. The processor is also just fine if not awesome. Am writing this review after 2 yrs of usage  .Daily usage : 2 hrs ( soft handling )I updated to latest andriod update . After that mobile not getting swicthed on . Only samsung logo is appearing .V worst experience . Checked with help center .they told will charge 6k but no warranty .Thrown away to e waste !! Overall great phone battery drain problem issue found speaker output quality not good I replace it on the first time but I didn\\'t meet the quality of sound in the bass and picture quality not too good I suggest those who want purchase this phone kindly think many times before purchasing this phone. Picture quality is not HD only written is HD+ poor quality. Great India festival is just to fool us and get benefit for Amazon.. my product received with defect piece..customer care executives and leadership guy guy we can not give replacement buy for now extra money..I took in in offer for less price got defect piece they say now to take me for higher price.. Excellent phone with reasonable price tag and with the assured service of Samsung. Camera quality is quite good compared to redmi (Chinese) products. Battery Life is awesome with fastest 80nm processor. Display is good but i was expecting fhd+ display but current quality is also good with 90hz display overall it is midrange phone and i satisfied with the phone Faulty product delivered to me worst experience mobile battery is no charging and having problem with connector. Picture quality also blurred in between watching videos. I have m31 mobile as well and try same charger too facing same issue. Product purchased just 3 months back. I need immediate refund or replacement of this product. Excellent phone in this range, with good battery, only thing of concern is its finger print reader location, many times login error appears due to different finger or hand location getting accidently touched to finger print reader, which is a bit annoying. Don\\'t buy this product bad  camera quality only battery back good .I have use this product and i am sharing the feedback . So please don\\'t buy go to some where else  likeVivo and Redmi. It\\'s a really very nice phone and good working also camera quality Good and battery backup too good 👍I liked product. Dislike: This phone could not able to find network  all time it goes to offline with the good network when we compare with other phones.I recommend to my friend also so it has the same problem.This phone is launched by Amazon only for their customers.From this we conclude whatever the company failure products are available in Amazon selling. Hai mobile is very bad every time heating at the time charging the time heating problem the mobile is worst mobile and Amazon customer very very very very worst customer and told there is no responsibilities in Amazon customer so many time I was calling Amazon customer but there is no response at Amazon customer A little bulky... in size and weight..Battery life is amazing.. i charge once in 2 days inspite of being on calls most of the day.Finger print is very quick n sensitive. But wrongly placed. Mostly it gets touched while taking out of the pocket n it says 5 incorrect finger prints and locks the mobile. Phone look like a ugly It\\'s shown 4 rear camera  and upto 48mp but worst that 5mp . Even a Chinese mobiles under 3000 value gives better  photos than this phone. Really  disappointed. Samsung is good brand.  I like this phone so very much, it has perfect camera quality, no hang issue, good sound quality and perfect in size and shape.  Fully satisfied according to price. Thanx Samsung for giving such a wonderful phone in reasonable cost. never buy this Samsung below 17k mobiles all the worst mobiles they wont function at all in all angles and more over battery 🔋 the worst experience Actually I bought this mobile for my mom, and she said that she is having a wonderful experience in using the mobile.To keep it simple, go for it Bought it for my mom as her note 5 pro was broken. This one is really good and she\\'s absolutely happy with the phone. this is the best phone I have ever used don\\'t listen to rumors about M12 everything display quality,  touch response, quick biometric, best camera true 48 mp, charged in just 2.5 hrs completely, decent sound quality go for it. Battery is goodCamera is not good. Zoom the images or a pic taken using zoom and all details are lost. Hoping Samsung release some update to improve it. It has pre-installed and unwanted apps so usable memory is less than expected. May be Samsung can keep these on cloud rather than phone and leave a choice to the user. Phone performance is good for daily uses. Battery performance is good enough for a day.i like fingerprint sensor is fast n simple to use. I\\'m disappointed with the given camera quality. Phone heating issues comes when used continuously with normal function and playing games.fast is not that fast. But I like this Phone at this price range. The screen is too fragile. My 5 year old accidentally dropped it twice. Both times the display shattered. This occurred within 2 months of use. The phone\\'s heavy to hold due to the big 6000 mAh battery, but still the battery life is not upto the mark. That\\'s disappointing. The fingerprint reader is fast and good. The camera quality is average. Overall the phone is average for the cost. And samsung is still the same, 100GB RAM is also too low for their mobile phone. It\\'s a beast at 9999 with ICCCI bank discount. 6000 mah battery with 24h+ backup. Ways camera which clicks beautiful pictures. TFT screen - can\\'t expect more with this price. Performance is good. And the best is the finger print sensor, it\\'s ultra first and the fingerprint on the power button makes the phone more beautiful. I have purchased this product almost a month ago, the product was defective since the voice of both side person was not audible. Hence I raised the request to return or replacement but till now nobody is arrived to my place. If you are not taking action on this, I need see for the further action to be taken Have used the phone for a month. Works very well so far, no obvious issues. Haven\\'t tried some features (e.g. fingerprint reader, dual Sim). It\\'s great that it utilizes Android 11  (the most recent version), although too many apps are preloaded. Camera/video recorder works well. Good product in this category. Exceeded my expectations. The Samsung Galaxy M12 is a Battery monster(as advertised) it will last a lot longer than the typical smartphone and it\\'s worth the money spent on it, my only problem is the 720p display, samsung could have gone with a 1080p oled but the display here is not horrible, the image quality is quite good actually, and One UI 3.1 is awesome. The newly lahnched phone is packed with everything that can come blow 13k inr. The camera The battery and The design of The phone is perfect in every manner. I recommend this product if someone wants a good smartphone under 15k. safety delivery.....exchange offer very good.......time of exchange within minute....phone price also very reasonable......... Not worth at all! Neither processor nor camera is good. Camera is so poor at this price range, better to look other option than this. Also the phone is super heavy. Low in signal whether it is network signal or wifi networkLagging alot because of samsung processor.Very disappointed. Best phone at this price range. Amazing battery life, only con is- selfie camera is not up to the  mark (according to MP level) Good mobile i buy this for my grandmaa she is happy 😊 battery backup is great and screen quality is quite impressive fingerprint is fast but camera is not like Samsung even j7 have good quality camera if we compare from this. 48 mp is blunder  quality is like 5 - 8 mp Lovely product. Great finishing. Loved camera quality.  Good mid range mobile at steal away price. Didn\\'t find finger print reader comfortable. May be I am used to back side finger print reader. 5000 mah better runs good. Would have loved if it was 6000. mah Newest and cool system for fingerprint, monster battery , charge is staying for 2 days al least.sleek design..fast processor.. camera good. Audio quality not good, can\\'t hear voice loud and clear on call, If planning to buy this for parents don\\'t buy, instead go for m21 if need a samsung phone only. Please don\\'t buy it. It\\'s been hardly a month since I bought this phone and it has hung already. The camera quality is not cool, the refresh rate is not at all good and most importantly, the battery capacity is not as good as promised. This phone is just another scam, don\\'t buy this. Don\\'t be fooled. Small budget but great quality in processor and batter life. Camera quality is not great but for the given budget it is ok. Heavier than m31. Bigger than m31 and better battery life than m31. Processor speed wise i feel same as m31. So if you are not much focused on camera, then this is best budget phone My main purpose was using phone for calls and what app. But after getting this product I started using games, started taking selfies and main thing started watching movies with HD quality... watching 2 movies per day with HD and still having battery life of 75%. It\\'s awesome. Fingerprint was quite good accommodated in power button. Selfie camera is not good.. But product design and performance not bad. under this price section is good. Sound quality is quite good. Not recommend for heavy gamer. There is no FHD. Got it for 9.5k and good phone, hangs a bit but ok for daily use Sad and Pathetic display, also feels like camelin geometry box in your hand, everything is slow abt this phone, u can have a tough tine woth the pjoje display  i wonder if these celebrities are using this phone :p Poor display, color contrast in this cellphone was very low . I don\\'t know it is particular my handset issue or something else. I had some urgency that\\'s why I was unable to replace that cellphone. But my advice is don\\'t buy this one. Their offers are just a scam to sell their poor products. Never buy this mobile to take indoor photos as it has a very poor quality camera. You can\\'t find yourself in photos if you took photo at night. It would be a total waste of money if it doesn\\'t have long battery life. yeh mobile lene ke baad mein chootiyan ban gaya....amazon customer wale ne muhje phir bhi chootiyan bana rahe hei... Nice phone. I have been using this phone for last 1months. According to me The best part of this mobile is the battery 🔋 Thank you . Very heavy weight. Average camera, very short usb cable. Also, did not get headphones with the package. Not that good for this price. I haven\\'t expected a better phone in this price range. Along with the brand name of Samsung you are getting great camera, great screen, great battery backup, and 2ghz quad core processor.It\\'s a great but until now. This phone is not up to mark like other Samsung mobile. It doesn\\'t have dual band WiFi connection. It doesn\\'t have 5Ghz WiFi receiver. It only has 2Ghz WiFi receiver. So you will get lesser speed when connected to 2ghz इस फोन में बहुत सारे प्रॉब्लम है चार्ज में लगाने के बाद फोन ऑटो ऑफ हो जाता है फिर उसे ऑन करने में घंटों लग जाते हैं मैं किसी को राय नहीं दूंगा कि इस फोन को परचेज करें और आप कभी भी आर्डर करें आपको सेकंड हैंड मोबाइल ही दिया जाएगा डिस्प्ले में डॉट रहता है बाकी बहुत सारे मल्टीपल प्रॉब्लम है फाइनली यह फोन नहीं लेना चाहिए Finger print reader on right side integrated with power button. Difficult to use the left hand fingers for reading the prints.... I bought this phone for my mother and am happy with the purchase. It is pretty easy to use for anybody in one\\'s household. The storage space,  and overall speed and performance of the phone is also great! Everything with the phone is super nice apart from a couple of things: finger reader lags for 2-3 sec before response & Google Maps keep on flickering while on navigation mode Received in damaged condition while calling display gone blank and I need to restart after every call to get display again. After using a few days...1. For normal user the phone is really Amazing2. Great battery backup with C-type charger3. Nice camera and very natural quality4. Safe and secure OS by Samsung5. Nice display qualityThanks amazon for your great service 👍 I had purchased this product on thebprime day announced by Amazon. As a prime customer, I thought there will be a discount but actually there was \"0\" discount on this mobile. It is available on the same price and with zero cost EMI on credit card.It\\'s just a marketing gimmick. The phone works fine and all but it is not pleasing to the eye. The colours of the screen are extremely desaturated and everything ends up looking dull or like there\\'s a Matte film on the screen. Very disappointing. Also Amazon will not let me return this product so now I am stuck with it. Disappointed in Amazon service as well. Recently bought samsung m12 6gb mobile. Within one week i am facing issue with phone mic. It is not working. When I started searching for the solution I came to know that the issue is with all the samsung latest releases. Really disgusting and now have to search for samsung service centre. Buy one and get your headache for free. ना तो dual app work करता है, second whatsapp data not showing second data, media file is मिसिंग, और तो और फोल्डर मे से फोटो अपने आप delete होते हे, samsung कंपनी solution not provide after 6 month, इसे तो चायनीज कंपनीया जलदी solution provide करती हे, please dont buy any samsung m series phone, total waste of money The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa06000 mah battery stands for two days.Camera quality is not much better with competitors. Performance is not good. But as a better battery backup it can be purchased. Not an option for heavy usage as the performance will tire us and it will not be fast enough. Overall  Phone is superb in this price range. Samsung need to make sure availability of suitable Covers so that it\\'s finger print reader is easily accessible. This phone is very good at this rate.  All its features are very good. Internal memory, RAM, Camera quality etc. Go for it. Finger - print reader is good but could have a little bit more sensitivity.Camera - It\\'s really goodBattery life - most attractive of all features. With normal use, it can stretch from 1 to 1.5 day backup. The camera quality and the battery health attracts the phone. The price range is really beneficial. People who need to click photos and watch Netflix and are internet savvy should have this. Price worthy overall. The processor is pretty good and fingerprint sensor could have been on the screen but presently it is not that bad. I expect fingers print reader should be on screen or back of the phone but it\\'s at the edge on power button which is uncomfortableRest is fine and better at this price Good battery life , fast charging is also good,Camera quality is better , phone doesn\\'t heat up while use for a long period, easy installation and procuring of your older data .If you are looking for a Good smartphone near about 10000 you must buy this item M12 . Do not buy.Waste of moneyFront camera have a huge issue. It\\'s manufacturing defectsI want to give 0 star, but option not available Worst mobile phone, I used it only 2 months it\\'s otg and fast changing system is being worsted, also network connectivity and internet connectivity very poor. Battery charging is very slow. Network automatically disconnected after using 20 to 30 minutes.and it\\'s connected again when you restart the phone 2-3 time continually. Pros:  -Good battery life  -Decent camera qualityCons:  -Display isn\\'t great,  -Processor is from old age.  -graphic quality is little rusty, visual quality is not sharp or vividVerdict:Their are many best alternatives Phones available for the price. Don\\'t go for M12/A12/F12 Its 90hz screen rates makes it seems best. Not for heavy gaming but still you can play games under 1GB in a quite good way. Impressed with battery life. The things I don’t like is the speaker. Speaker are a bit low. Rest is great. I got this for 9499 ₹ Sometimes laggs, face unlock is very slow, camera quality is not as mentioned.Fingerlock is good, battery is good.Automatic brightness function is not good.Paisa kam ho to hi lena.

I purchased 2 mobile of M12 Performance is quite good. If you want a phone for gaming its suitable for it but can\\'t play games which are more than 800 minutes like free fire or pubg you can play free fire in the settings smooth. If you want this phone for regular purposes then its a good phone it has smart view and quite good features. Value for money. Very bad camera especially when did a 10X Zoom the picture is highly pixelated .. instead of this pls prefer redmi note 9https://amzn.to/3fe0y2F It is a decent phone. Camera is good. Battery is excellent. For day to day use you can buy it. If you are a heavy user or if you are looking for a phone for heavy gaming then its not for you. Overall good. 4 star. Thats all I am very disappointed with the purchase I get annoying ads very often I don\\'t know how to remove then even I tried every method to remove them please help me to get rid of this  I don\\'t know I have bought this in sale that\\'s why this problem is happening if you cannot solve it I recommend every one to not. Buy this phone . The phone is very nice at a price point of 13,500 provided type C although fast charging is not supported it\\'s still good . While rear camera is Very Good and the camera app s UI is very good with many features and modes  but the Front Camera is ok not that amazing . And at last a huge storage of 128gb make it a good deal . The phone is good. Have no complaint on that but the phone is missing on gyroscope sensors. This is dissappointing. I like the battery life, it\\'s quite impressive. Unlike things are camera quality n bit heavy the phone is. Rest are good Fingerprint sensor: Best place and fast readerBattery life on my regular usage (from 100% to 0%): Perfect 2 daysRefresh rate: Smoothest than any other smartphone in the marketSpeakers quality: Better than Xiaomi phonesCamera (48MP vs Redmi Note 7 pro 48MP): Better colors and sharpness. When I charge my phone over heat create and also i am watch video 30mins over heat create camera clarity very worst 48MP camera is fack and also night time I take one photo very worst quality picture I am not recommend any one to buy this mobile please not value for money Battery life is really good. Design is also very good. Quad camera quality is really impressive at this price. Good sound quality and refresh rate is also awesome. Fingerprint reader works very smoothly. Good if you have limited budget of this price range. Otherwise some other models are better. Smoothness of scrolling is not good as compare to higher model With in the day the phone has many problems,hanging,low battery performance,So i decided to return my order,but the amazon service was worst,they r not come to pick up the phone from the last 35 days and the phone was unused and it is packed,Amazon not showed any schedule to pickup.worst service The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Mobile is Good and value for money.Weakness - Speaker is not much loudDisplay is good not very Good..in this price segment. After 2 months usage. My honest reviewPros:1. performance is op2. 8nm processor and 6000mah battery life is very nice3. Fingerprint and display is very goodCons:Only con is camera is very bad in low light.... But camera is not my priorityYou can go with it if you are a medium user I recommend not to buy.Samsung downgraded all the Processor, Display, Camera.Its doesn\\'t seems like a Samsung phone.Other phones like Xioami, Redmi, Vivo, Oppo are better than this at this price. From day one touch not working and still now same issue. Cost and features are good but, camera quality not impressive, most of the time touch not working, seems in this model have issue with the touch, specifically when you start using you will observed. Avoid purchasing this model. I am planning to exchange this phone. Delivered in time. pack intact. Performance seems to be very good. Camera features are very good. It is worth buying!! Pathetic experience, 1st one received eith scraches,then have to replaced,have heating issue,charger is very poor ,need 3 and half hours for full charge..... After receiving the phone front camera lens is damaged after so much trouble and complaint made at samsung service centre i got my phone repaired after 2 monthsTotal failure phone Amazon great Indian festival  sale price 9499 and after using credit card I got 10 percent off....Mobile is not come with case and screen guard  so I have to buy it separately...including  all accessories  it cost me 8000....so I think it\\'s a good deal...4 64 90hz refresh rate,48 mgpxl,6000 may....same like f12 ..Thanks Amazon I dont know what is it, but when i switch on my phone and put password it going switch off Automatically. I don\\'t see this issue first few days but within month i\\'m facing this issue and this happen again and again. And my bad luck is am not able to return it because of return policy was expire. 😡😡😡🤬🤬 I bought this assuming a Samsung mobile, but its just a ripoff of some cheap mobiles available. Extremely heavy and sometimes even gets hot. Even the glass is not smooth as it used to be Great features but then those are available in cheap variants as well. Changed my rating after using it for a few months Not so good, just average.Even it\\'s getting hot while calling someone, i don\\'t know samsung m 12 follows or not SAR regulations.But i just want a non Chinese phone so i bought this, but there more options available here in samsung and others.And also a better option is Micromax (part -2). For First time I got used phone from Samsung dealer.I can see seal is broken will open the package,few app are installed and used. In Amzon it is new launch but i got used product. I got mobile on 17/10/21. But i can see it is used by someone in before week.  Share the pic of data usage. May I know its republish product A good phone for someone who knows the samsungs ui, or els much better phone available in the market. The only issue with the phone is that it does not support the 5ghz band of wifi routers. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Good phone at this price segment... We love samsung from the beginning and hence choose to get this mobile again as usual samsung is best for its camera, battery and processorKeep giving such budget phones to people Battery 🔋support is awesome 👌 once charged will last for 1.5 days.. Camera 📷 is okay average. display and touch screen is okay.. Mobile fingerprint key is design scope for improvement.. Currently is quite inside compared to volume key so little discomfort to operate but overall okay value for money 💰 Good and no regrets for what it does.It\\'s worth for what you pay for. Happy with the cameras and battery life. I bought 2 phones of Samsung M12 from 2 different dealers..this black phone I ordered has a speaker issue and is having a very poor wifi connectivity range.im not happy as I have got this 1 piece damaged and couldn\\'t exchange or rectify.i am under warranty but I\\'m unable to exec Good product from Samsung I like this productExcellent battery life,very good phone for daily usage.In this budget  this is good and awesome. Audio quality is good,display is above average.All Samsung apps support  to this device also good ms office apps also supported.Totally it is worth to money. I bought this phone because it\\'s battery backup is good and 128 gb memory... Camera is not up to the mark... But ok.. But samsung f12 make more sense to buy.. All the features are same except the Processor... And f12 is cheaper also.. I say go for it or u can also check samsung f12 it will save your money a little... Bought it for my father, the deal was amazingly cheapbut phone is great!!. Camera is very clear and screen quality is very good.Fingerprint sensor is placed on the side so feels a bit difficult but overall the product is very nice.i would definitely recommend. The phone is the worst one. I wish i had chance to choose another mobile. It did not yet pass one month even at the time of return of the first phone.. I\\' m ready to sell this phone. I\\'m not all content with this phone in case of Camerala quality. I just got 3680 rs.. for exchange of m12 phone. I\\'m ready to sell it. Very much nice phone for the older people or parents, because they wont play games, so without games rest all are ok Within 1 week charger gone dead. Handset has no any problem. But at that time handset was not charging. I was very disturbing. I don\\'t know why samsung did thing like this. They make a good phone but I don\\'t know why 1 thing they always downgrade. In this phone the camera is wrost even other mobile 8 mp is better than its 48 mp. Rest all is good in this range This product is defective. Camera and touch response very bad.battry time only 1hour. And delivery boy is not delivered parsel at my home.10 km away from my home and he ask and take order. Liked the storage and camera quality is decent don\\'t use the camera much so does not matter. Lot of blotware which installs unwanted apps.No option to take screenshots have to press the volume and power button. Brought if for my Mom. She is using it now. Camera is ok. Battery life is not like as we expected. No overheating. Sound quality good. My brother uses it for playing games also. He didn\\'t find any drawback. That\\'s it Third class product.Camera quality So poor.Front camera and rear camera both  quality very poor.very basic camera app.Only  battey back up is good.Not recommended. Better buy any redme phone.So poor quality  product Best phone to buy in this price range .Battery backup is awesome. Phone body is good . Camera is decent OK OK types.Powered by Knox security. The description said in box headset, charger, and manual will come in box with this phone, but headset is not there. Received the mobile on the launch dateCamera is averageBattery seems goodSeems some resolution issue , Youtube or Facebook videos are not showing in better qualityThere is no magnetic sensor (the compass app not working )Sound seems very low (speaker) for calls and songs The phone is too too heavy.Not sure if that is just coz of the battery or wrong product design.It\\'s getting heated too early when we put it on charge. Edited after a use of fee months and the experience is getting bad to worse. some features need to be added and improved. Some software does not update. Even its own firmware does not update. Now i have to visit samsung service centre. Really disappointing. Very worst product.lagging.battery written 6000 mah but not works for even a day. Battery drainage problem. No sensor gyroscope, written one UI 3.1 but gives core version of UI. Never buy this phone never. Don\\'t buy samsung cheap phone they are always worst. Even redmi go has better feature then this cheap phone. CON:1.it is heavy2.Refresh rate not as per specifications.3.Camera quality is  not @per specifications  48 megapixcel.4.Display AveragePRO1.Battery life is a brilliant2.Voic Quality is  OK do not buy any samsung mobile from the amazon they are just fooling yhe prople on the name of return policy ,camera picture quality is worst than 5 mega pixle5 camera howrver they are not ready to return , bad experience with samsung i bought first mobile of samsung very bad If you want a basic phone which satisfies the needs, go for it.Although some might find it too big& bulky for its size. Horrible! The phone doesn\\'t support dual band in wifi. So we can connect only 2.4 and not 5. How ridiculous of the company to not be even honest about it I bought this phone for my father. What a best phone, Clean interface, easy to use,best battery (I charged full 2 days back and still battery running 50%, happy) best camera performance. Its a very good phoneThe camera quality is very good whoever has written worst camera actually dont know how to use itSomeone interested in this phone can definitely buty it as it is very good phone . Design is also very good and in hamd feel is very good fits perfectly well in our hand I was looking for a budget mobile handset with decent battery back up and enough internal storage. I must say I got what I was looking for. I have purchased this one few days back , so it\\'s quite tough to write anything in details. But in short I can say first impression is not so bad. Display not up to the mark. But with dedicated SD slot you can expand memory and also have two SIMs. Meets my requirement and quite happy with the product. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Pros-Excellent phone in budget. Good camera quality, even in night (No night mode, only tubelight or flash). Battery is awesome.Con-mobile is bulky. An average phone with average camera  and feels heavy, don\\'t expect too much with quad cameraFrom the first day of usage itself I feel a bit sluggish in every way Camara Quality very worst  like 2MP..Performance is not that much level. Quality level not comparable from Sumsung old brand..Battery also 6000Mah  but comparable @4000 Mah..All specifications given high level and performance is low.How it was  certified the specifications.. Don\\'t  buy this phoneThere is everything wrong with  this phoneCamera ( even my 5mp front( of Samsung j7) camera is better than there 8 mp front cameraAnd also i hardly  used it for 10 minute  and it started  heatingDidn\\'t  expect  this type of think from Samsung Not a good phone.Camera quality not goodPhone hangs at timesWhen it hangs nothing works and you don\\'t have any option other than to wait till the system error is resolved on its own.. Not recommended for purchase Phone was of very good quality.  Camera quality is okay okay.. but it\\'s overall good for someone who has minimal usage. Battery life is also upto the mark. Go for it if you don\\'t have heavy usage with your phone. I facing problems since starting. Up to 5 days worked good. After that it is not connecting to the network properly and voice disturbances several times. Majorly it going to auto switch off and some time restart. Worst product, I had seen purchased last month and now screen is not working, cusotmer centre saying that phone is bend......how\\'s that possible as I hadn\\'t kept the same in pocket even till now No doubt mobile just awesome. But camera quality below average. I have Samsung galaxy j7 nxt. Better picture from M12 If you want a good battery life, good fingerprint scanner and a good-really good camera for a budget, then this is the way to go.P.s  this phone looks pretty dope actually. I LOVE THE blue color. Blue is samsung\\'s natural colour After 6 month of purchase..I reviewed for this smartphone plz guy dnt buy it. Totally waste of money. Camera quality not good. Phone heating issue several time without any load on its OS. WTF. . paise barbad. 🙁 Not going in detail regarding the device, already a lot has been said.Average device, but with a premium feel.Point of concern- The camera!! Will bring tears to your eyes. 64 MP maybe the talking point, but the sensor is absolute crap. Brought this for my uncle..Overall satisfied with the product..Got this for 10.5k during the sale go for it if you are looking for a mobile in 10k range..Would not suggest for heavy gaming.. good for Day to day use. Battery life for 2 and half days easily.Ample memory and storageCamera quality good. Can be with more zoom. Samsung reliability Just worth @8500 rupees.Lot of software glitches.Battery backup for 1 and half days on moderate use. Worst phone.  एक दम बकबास है,  स्क्रीन शॉट सिस्टम बहुत ख़राब है,  स्क्रीनशॉट लेते समय अपने आप safe mode में चला गया,  data डिलीट करने के बाद भी start nhi hua.ऊपर से lockdown,  चार्जिंग बहुत slow Samsung best product value for Money for All angles battery life and camera is a very good andside mounted fingerprint sensor is a very fast and face unlock is a very fast so enjoyable phone All of goodThank you Amazon And Samsung. Very disappointed from this mobile, display quality is bad, camera is not like 48MP overall feel is not good with this mobile.. Excellent product. Value for money. Camera is good. Battery backup good. Fast charging. No hanging & heating problem. Display quality excellent. Using this mobile for past one week and, all I could say is this will never disappoint you. Battery is excellent. Rear camera is good than what I expected. I love the look of the mobile and sound quality is good. It supports Dolby Atmos which is good. U can definitely go for it without any second thoughts. When i on internet that time mobile is overheating issue...and camera quality is very poor... Please dont buy this phone Not a bad phone but sound quality is very low even with loudspeaker on.This is very bad for this mobile.When  more than 2 people are connected on whatsapp conference mobile goes on mute and other people can\\'t hear our voice. At this price good try by Samsung. But some thing missing.This is a average mobile for market.Wright now processor should be new like market phone. Phone is good but it\\'s very heavy, just because it has 6000mah battery , phone battery make it lil bit thik which is uncomfortable The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I got this product at 9k after discount . The fingerprint sensor is worst whereas battery and camera are ok. The screen function lags sometime but after latest update few of the bugs solved Not so fast as expected.It’s back camera is higher qualityBut it’s Front camera is very low quality.Buy it for 1 yr next generation 5 GIs coming for better experience... Im giving one star bcz it is necessarily too select  star den only  we cn write reviewReally  unhappy  with dis phone 😑🤢😡😡😡🤬Battery  life is not good at allCamera quality is also very poorWhile using  d phone  it get heat upEven while charging  time it heat up... i purchased M12 this week 6gb ,128 gb. i amazed about the battery back up . it has excellent speed while browsing .In this price range , no best model avaialble . earlier i have been using A70 which is high end but still M12 is performing same. thanks samaung for the wonderful research for this product.. The battery life is appreciable and also it looks nice (just a little heavy ) . It works smoothly but for some reasons it doesn\\'t feel like 90hz . The camera is average and i expected better but in this price range it\\'s not a very big flaw . The usb cable in the box is really short in length . The fingerprint sensor works good. Camera quality very good , currently I am attending online classes and at the end of the day Charing is 13 - 15% left . You can go for it . I am using this model from past 2 months. Good product by specs and everything, this is the best you can get in terms of battery life, speed and camera. Only one con is that for 6000 mAH battery it feels a bit bulky but you will get used to it. 6 months free replacement offered to prime members is a total fraud. Neither Amazon or their partner Savex technologies respond. If you want full control of your phone.. don\\'t buy this one. This phone work on its own...it will download many apps which you don\\'t even know without asking you... So be aware... Overall performance is good but the display resolution is 720p which is the worst part of mobile.Camera is OK.90hz refresh rate is good.Fingerprint sensor is great.Eventually I would not recommend to buy this mobile if you are not samsung lover.In this price range there are other good option too. Not such a bad product with in this budget it will perform a heavy1-camera wise its ok dont expect much2-battery life superb no doubt3-finger print is quite difficult to use my suggest is to place it on back then it will be good4-over all worthy product Charger  hitting proplme and prosser  bad  and video recording  sitting nahi h and app drawer  sitting nahi h very poor quality, good  fingerprints , good  battery,  camera low quality M12 has very worst lcd display which is not even good for the eyes.camera quality is worst,video quality is not so good.Generally if you are thinking that product has many features then you will be mistaken.not worth of money so choose a better and high end product in Samsung. The phone is too heavy to handle camera is too poor battery ok. Overall Amazon service is bad I tried to return product but before delivery but no option to return and process refund even customer service also bad because I paid online I have to product even though I didn\\'t like really disappointed 😞 Good budget phone for normal user. Great battery life. General samsung performance.Used for 2 months. If your bugets fits will recommend this phone.Not for Gamers :). Go away gamers from this device. Product was bought without physically checking it. I preferred Samsung over Chinese phone but their phone design is far better than Samsung in same budget. Screen is too big to hear any call, speakers are very bad, overall design is not very good, heavy to handle. Decent phone with good battery back up more than 1 day with good usage. Design is good to hold in hand. Screen is good. Touch is good. Camera is ok types with decent pics in daylight however in artificial light its average.Overall a decent buy at this price. Hangs a bit but other wise it\\'s a decent buy for a normal user camera is average this review is afer a months use  samsung apps are useless only taking up space, battery is good 1.Poor Display2.Poor Camera.3.Too much slow performance is too poor4.Plastic quality.5.No Gorilla Glass.6.Poor Toch for FingprintGood1.Good Batter Life Not a good mobile, not expected this kind of mobile from Samsung.Battery - not standing even a day.Full charging takes 3 hours to charge battery.Camera quality is not good.Mobile fast- working with 2gb ram speed instead 4gb ram High level - it\\'s goodCons -It feels like so much weight.While using much time, it becoming slow.Camera is but slow compared to other android\\'s.Pros -Great design.Much battery life.Big screen to view movies & games. Performance is good but Camera is very poor and 90 h display is not helping in making a undersaturated display little fun in daily use.In this price range go for Mi Finger print reading is fast and battery life is good, camera quality should be improved. One can go for this mobile, expect camera all features are reached expectations. This phone is great at the price range of under11k . This phone has good camera, battery is awesome and the 90 hz display is great but the pros in this phone is it does not have gyroscopic sensor which is to be their at this price range also at this price range they should provide us a good display. Camera and battery is ok but speed of processor in not satisfactory.After a month use of mobile touch screen not sensing properly. Don\\'t buy this mobile.This Mobile don\\'t have very common senser like megnatometer.It does not properly work. Map compass not workMany time open another app automatically.Service center didn\\'t fix this problem. He said me this type of problem are general in Samsung smartphone. Battery is too good at its performance. Camera was as it is specified in the specs. Display is also good I loved it, Great Battery life , Screen Quality,  and Camera Quality is also Good. I\\'m happy with the product. I purchased 6gb, one week back, but still it is hanging and speaker not working properly,  sometimes it plays as beep noise. Samsung becomes worst quality nowadays, Fingerprint Scanner still i unable to find. Very Slow gets stuck while using. Dont waste money instead add some more money and buy good mobile Worst experience. First time received phone with speaker issues and second time on replacement received damaged peice.Worst standard of quality by a big brand name. I am using it since a month.. and it is working very smoothly..Fingerprint reader is very goodBack Camera is Bestt.. and selfie camera is GoodPerformance is best for a normal user .. I am not using it for gaming or anything like that..Normal user can buy it without any doubt The overall phone is good big display big battery life and fingerprint sensor is fast enough camer peformance is good in day lighting condition but if lighting conditions are not good then picture will be below average also the processor is only capable of daily task it is not ment for heavy taking I purchased this mobile in Deepawali offer in just 9000 Rs. No equivalent phone is available in this price range. Want to buy second one but the price is high now. Battery last longer than one day, finger print sensor is on side button, camera quality is great. pros-good build quality-nice battery-fast charging-nice interface fully customizable-edge panel comes in handycons-no gesture support for media and other functions-face recognition is very slow-no 5ghz wifinote:after more than a month use Brought this M12 Samsung device on 19th Mar 2021. Device is excellent/ responding quickly / no heating even after continuous usage for 4 hours / Good battery backup.  I feel only one drawback that is the battery charging.....it\\'s taking 2.5 hour\\'s for full charge but Samsung saying Fast Charging.  Good to buy. An initial impressionPros:Excellent battery life; low power consumption due to the advanced 8nm designGood displaySufficient processing power for an entry level phoneMost bloatware can be uninstalled Overall phone quality is good except camera is only 13 megapixel in stead of 48 megapixel.That is cheatibg by samsung with customers so please stop. I have purchased in 8549 Rs. OnlyBattery backup,fingers lock ,face lock is very good and working smoothly. Please don\\'t choose this phone, sim not working on it. Not taking network properly.no internet no clear phone calls even can\\'t send message...we changed network but no use...but the same sim working perfectly on other phones.. I am trying to call customer support...no use at all there Overall performance of the mobile is averageWe are not expecting  from Samsung for making fool to customer in camera quality( 48 mobile quad camera )which doesn\\'t better than even 2MP.Doesn\\'t  value  for money.,we will find much better phone at this 10k range. Great phone with brilliant battery life. Worth buying it from a trusted company. The camera and display quality are outstanding. Overall, an unmatchable made-in-India product. (1)-Processor is worst(don\\'t even manage to play background song while downloading any stuff)(2)-audio recording quality is the third class(3)-except for these 2, everything is well. Don\\'t buy this mobile because this Mobile in call spiker in different voice in this mobile . Spiker is so bed and bsnl net work problem in this mobile . Because my simple mobile in bsnl card work properly but Samsung m 12 mobile in bsnl card not work properly. Average phonePros: Just good battery and big screenCons: very poor camera, heating while chargingI want to exchange this junk to another phone but it doesn’t show up on the list of exchanges on amazon. i like battery and look.display is not good as amoledperformance is also not goodand finally calling is have worst in every time.... i m too disappointed with his calling performance.. Phone is very heavy and becomes uncomfortable to hold during a long call.. camera quality is also sub par Phone is very smooth and handy.Battery Backup is very nice.Camera quality is also nice.Phone is little heavy but solid body.Gorilla glass screen is also very good .Sound quality with Dolby atmos feature makes it perfect. Size is more enough for watching movies and games. The phone is a dud,, hangs and heat up. Bought two sets for my parents and both are extermely sad about the waste of money.. Grand display ND big display... amazing fingerprint button 🔘...superb touch screen....nyc color ..bettery backup life is longer ... camera 📸 quality is very good.... I have purchased this phone for one of my relatives he is very happy from the performance . He is lite user not satisfied in camera quality, and battery lifenot real 48mp camera.. and battery life is one and half day only but rarely used mobile my family.. total waste for money,, and worst samsung product of M12 Mobile I really don\\'t have to write a long review if you are looking to buy this phone this is your sign go for it it\\'s the best decision I made works like a champ Except battery backup nothing is goodCamera worstPerformance very slowEach action be it dialing a number, opening call history or whatever it is there will be 3-4 seconds delay Poor camera , bad Battey , heating up, hangs from day 1, bad service & product of Amazon.They are not replacing the product & asking to check through a software. Don’t get trapped Good one for that price. Need to see how\\'s the phone performance  will be. Till now it was good 👍 since one week I am using it I am very disappointed with galaxy m12. Its very costly. But features are not as an expensive mobile. 1.Hanging2.Speaker Volume is very less - Unable to hear songs and Talk clearly.3.While receiving call  unable to attend -4.Battery Charging time is moreI love to use SAMSUNG Mobiles ,But this time i am totally disappointed with this model. Finger print: it is very easy to access this M12 model during ON and OFF mobile.Battery life: it is very useful for me and battery life 3 days even I am attending my kids Online classes.Camera quality: It\\'s good clarity back and front camera. even after zoom image pixel very clear. Finger print awesome, camera as always very nice...Battery not as expected still m doubt is it 6000mah or what...Reviewing after 4th day use complete Warning: Don\\'t buy this phone or else you\\'ll repent a lot.This phone was delivered to me on 4th December 2021. For the first few days, the phone worked nice but after that it started hanging a lot. The overall performance is very bad for this phone. Please don\\'t purchase it. Super battry life......Super displayCamera is.....good not best one. But at this price point its better than other ....... because of samsung.Sometime lag....idont know why. The phone is really good and I gifted it to my Fiance.. the camera, processer, display, refresh rate are advantages. Samsung worst product of the year. Within 3 months display is not working. Very slow, very bad UI experience. I will never go for Samsung mobile in future I got this for my dad and he is loving it.Though he doesn\\'t play games in this, for watching videos its excellent. Fingerprint sensor is goodBattery life is also nice i. E 1.5 days including internet browsingCamera quality is not that much good as per the expectations. There is no feature for slow motion and also the quality of picture gets ruptured or say not so good when zooming the image . I bought this for my grandparents. According to its price this phone is a good choice but then it can\\'t be used for a longer period of time as it gets heated up within a few time of usage. The camera quality is satisfactory. This phone is not for gaming brats as it gets heated up way sooner. Fast Chsrging? Not even in your Dream!!Operating speed worst!!Hitting problem while chargingNot even charging in normal speed forget about 20w fast chsrgingAlmost ..Disappointed.Wast of hard earned money.I just want to have refund against this waste model. I expected this phone to have better picture quality. It is very bad.Home screen and apps are opening too slow. Didn\\'t expect this with Samusung own processor (Exynos) and octa cores. It is a big let down.There is no return option also with this phone. Too bad. very disappointed. Good Delivery!Excellent Display, more wider and more fascinating.!Great Camera. I am really happy with the product, it has all modern features which I wanted. Good Camera, good Display, also battery backup is quite good. Can\\'t expect more with this budget. This mobile is the one of the worst mobile I have seen in my life.. too much lag.. applications take lots of time to open.. camera quality is very poor.. overall my suggestion is not to buy this mobile..you may go with poco, OPPO, MI in same range. Please don\\'t buy this product. Brought this mobile on the launch date and express delivery.kudos.Pros: Sleek and good .Pic quality is ok but not as 48MPBattery backup , so far good.Cons:Volume not upto the mark.Fast charging is ok but actually doesn\\'t fullfill what fast charging to do. We had to get a mobile phone for an online school for girls.I got this phone delivered on 07th October.  The phone is very nice.  But today, on the fifth day, there is a real noise in his speaker.  Please tell, what to do...........  This is a request for early notification. Harish B.Kedare Fingerprint reader is good.The display of the phone is dull. If you have used Samsung phones and switch to this model, you can clearly makeout the difference. Display could have been better actually.Camera quality is ok, ok.Battery lasts for a day. Very very happy good quality smartphone display quality excellent & performance very very fast refresh rate 90h value for money samsung hd display but quality very very good redmi note 10 Full HD Amoled display not good my experiences samsung display good quality hd Front Camera quality is bit low (as it is 8MP)Battery average (around 5000mah type)90hz refresh rate is okayOverally 3.8-4.2 starsIf you are looking for a big battery big storage with 6GB ram phone go for itIf you are a camera person this phone is not for you!! Looks very ordinary phone, just compated it with old model Redmi released 3-4 years back, they look far better than this mobile.. Samsung to up their standards quality wise as well. Poor Camera and looks very very ordinary. The touch sensors are the worst part and what is smart phone if the touch doesn\\'t work. On a broader perspective all Samsung phones are the same. Try redmi, moto or oneplus if your budget is there. Worst mobileIsse accha to maine jo mobile exchange kiya tha wo tha bhot afsos hua mujhe apne decision pePerformance is lagging a lotNot a good dealWorst product in this rangeCamera dull, performance slow ,hang started 2nd day just waoHorrible product Fast and snappy budget phone with good battery. First I thought screen was not full HD will be an issue but trust me the quality of this panel is so good that you barely notice anything. I am currently using one plus 8 also and this seem good for day to day usage . On thish price it\\'s a very good mobile. It\\'s my 1 month experience that1. No hanging2. Amazing battery3. Amazing camera 📷4. Refresh rate is higher5. It\\'s a amazing mobile in this price 😃6.Dark modeI\\'m very setisfy, you can try. All are ok.  Good product>specially battery, back camera & finger print lock 😄It might be better if the front camera became so good 😒Mobile phone is very nice but I found the issue in front camera 😒 quality of photos taken by front camera is not very good but in day time it is OK. After 3 weeks usage of this phone .It was budget mobile under 10k.. those who are looking budget brand can choose these mobile because camera , phone ram speed , gaming etc.... Can order this mobile overall everything fine In this budget you are getting a decent deal with all specifications Samsung is providing. Only drawback I have observed is that this devise is not get connected with 5G Wifi. But you will get monster battery and decent camera quality and on the top of it. SAMSUNG brand value. Bought this mobile a month back. Just using for callls and not even download any apps. But with in a month it\\'s started hanging and touch also has the problem it automatically gets touched in multiples places and reacts wildly.Amazon not providing option for replacement. Phone specifications are good. Latest version of software pls good camera quality. Overall very happy with the phone. Value for money. The phone in white looks primly good.Mobole phone is alot heavy to hold in one hand..Battery capacity lasts for good 2days.Camera is smooth.. in-menus display refresh rate is fast.Phone lags like a second while interchanging aps Brought it for 8.5k and its best for the money.good build quality, camera is also good and good battery life . If u want to waste money, buy this phone.It is extreme bad 👎 product. Speaker is fully damaged. I buyed it and it has inbuilt speaker problem. ₹900will need to repair it.  And instead it is 4gb 64 internal it hang\\'s a lot. I will give you advice not to buy this product. It is defective. Don\\'t buy this product,  as I believe because  of SamsungCamara even normal  12mp is better clarity as comparing  this phone  48mp...Battery  is OKDisplay not expected  clarity. Most of it is good except the speaker .Even at full vol setting sound is inadequate even in comparison  with other samsung phones such as M10. Very bad product faulty peiceBad Voice is not proper at all der is default in piece plzzz recheck and take or. Return the cellohone not clear mic This phone can be used just for talking purpose, No fingerprint reader option in this mobile, camera quality is not good, it\\'s very average, battery is ok and it exist for one day, Mobile is too weight and feels pain if hold for few minutes, totally average phone Front camera is not clear shoot any picture. I think improve front cameras through Samsung m12. And also back cameras average. Good pictures take by m12.Battery life is very goodFinger lock is also good not v good.And mobile looking is  very good and pretty Just a word don\\'t buy any products of Samsung because once it got default you have to pay for that Samsung service centre won\\'t get it correct under warranty.  Please don\\'t buy. Little weighty compare to other market leading handsets. And sometimes it hangs if you gaming. But overall it is good for daily use mobile in budget price. Finger print reader is good,battery life is excellent,and camera is averageBut the delivery boy is not good and sincere, he is delivered the package without calling me and he is handover the package the other guy without my permission this not so good for Amazon\\'s reputation I have bought M12 mobile on Apr2021 and the cost of Rs.90000/-. It was working good and when you playing the games got struck up. So I\\'m strongly not recommended for game players. Good performance from last 10days(the day I bought it) classy look and better performance with multitasking and multiple profiles. As I have official and personal Apps profile configured on to it. Works amazingly on both Too heavy for a person to hold it in a pocket and it’s thickness is also more. Over all a bulky good phone at its 10-11k price. after using for month feel it is value for money.  battery stays charged for days.  better would be more powerful charge it takes bit of time to charge battery. Around 10,000 ho for it until better arrives. Not for gaming. For normal people the phone is best I like  all , only  display  build  quality  is  low  no  gorrila  glass..protection. I  drop  only  one time  and  it  will  crack  accidently . Over all the Phone is fine. The worst part is the Camera, 48 MP is a joke, the photos are pixelated. Shoot in broad daylight its looks fine but zoom in and its pretty bad. Samsung I hope will come up with an update to make the camera really worth it. Phone is heavy. Camera quality is not upto the mark when compared with redmi note 9 and other phones in same category.Display is just average.Speed is good. Remaining all the features are good Charger not working within a month of purchase.The mobile is very good for its price.The fingerprint & face recognition is not upto mark.Camera & battery are good Fingerprint  sensor is very bad, camera quality is worst, battery life is not performing like a 6000 mah. Phone started hanging from the day 2nd. Build is good. Any phone of Xiaomi, even lower than this price will be performing much more better than this phone. Delay in Screen response.No compass app runs as basic requirement of compass app doesn\\'t meet.Front camera resolution is low.Phone gangs some time.Won\\'t recommend at this price. Although it says 48 MP camera, it just clicks  like a VGA shots or 5MP shots in a broad daylight. Don\\'t know why with triple camera lense they give such poor quality. Battery life is good The display of the mobile is so poor that even a 7000/8000 range cheap mobile has much better display than this mobile. The charging rate is so slow that it takes around 3 hours to charge the battery fully. It ruined the joy of buying a new mobile , extremely disappointed. The Sumsung Mobile which I purchased from Amazon, is very poor quality & getting hung & facing  so many times.Today I can\\'t call also.Before that I want to return or replace this one. But nobody attends me.I am a prime member & purchase so many goods. So you people solve this problem. Battery is good lasts for 1day after continue net brwosingFingerprint is good as expectedCamera quality quite best Camera quality I am wondering why there are claiming 48MP. Previously I used Samsung j7 max 16mp that can take better pictures.Battery Good.Processor Good for normal usage.Fingerprint sensor so Good.Overall good budget phone for normal usage. A great Deal for its price. Doesn\\'t feel any lag, screen feels fluid.Only Con is its camera which is still great for its price but not on par with mid-rangers. With new replacement phone is very good and fast. Multi tasksing also more good. Battery life is awesome. On the whole best phone at this budget The product started lagging since day 1.Asked Amazon for replacement and they assures to send a engineer for inspection. The person never came and my inspection was marked resolved. It was a huge shame as I had gifted this to my Mom Battery life is very good. But it\\'s fast charger is slower than Redmi Note 5 pro normal charger.Camera quality is also good in this price range. I have purchased this mobile for my child\\'s online classes. My child is fully satisfied with its performance. Phone is good with good batter back up, good finger Print sense, good speed for gaming as well as for other activities.Only drawback is poor display and , poor picture / photos quality. I\\'ll not recommend this for Photo Lovers as quality of picture / photos are bad. I am little bit worried about this product, it is 6000mAH battery but the charge exhausted within 24 hours. Second, charger is 15w fast charger but it takes almost 2hours 20 minutes for full charging. Third, Camera quality is not like 48mp. I am not fully satisfied with this product. This is a good budget phone. 6GB Ram is a plus point here. Display is decent. 90 Hz makes a difference while scrolling and feels smooth. Loaded with good Samsung features. Rear Camera is decent in day lightings. Front camera is poor. Phone is heavy but its ok once get habitual to it. The item was superb and premium quality and the camera quality was best but I don\\'t know why people are hating it . Thank you Amazon for giving us a great item🤗🤗😍 It is quite slow Bought the mobile for 13000,worth the money.Fingerprint reader is averageBattery life goodCamera quality is averagePerformance is good Other brands are giving better quality, but I have never tried samsung this time i tried to check and it\\'s failed for me.. Worst phone in market in this range. Screen quality very bad, camera very bad, screen touch not working well, getting hanged. Samsung disappointed. Amazon thanks for your great support to accept return request after knowing the details ! Using few months..... no problem arise... GOOD Product Very Poor front camera. not recommended to buy who want good camera. battery backup also not at per as 6000 mah battery. camera features is very less. no slow motion video features available. I have been using this mobile from last 20 days. The battey life of this mobile is just awesome 👌.The fingerprint reader in also good and I like the fingerprint system at power on button.This mobile make me sad by seeing the camera quality. Offcourse camera dosen\\'t matter if you are not interested to click more photos This product has many issues:1. Mobile will show many attempts has been done to unlock the phone even if ur phone is in ur pocket.2. Mobile shows wrong network name on the screen.3. Heating problem.4. Sometime apps close suddenly.5. Internet drop issue. The display, camera, touch, everything is great. The battery backup is great. Just that it\\'s a bit heavy. I bought this mobile for my father,  will be a good fit for him but only backdrop for this mobile will be camera , there\\'s no proper quality for images captured by this mobile (Both front and Rear Camera quality is poor) rest all features are upto the mark . The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Its a good product In its segment.. does pretty much everything for an average user who uses the phone for normal apps and not too heavy usage.. rest everything is premium Camera quality is avarage . display quality also bad,10000 segment worst mobile.dust in side the mobile box and top of display. when open the mobile box i found so much dust on mobile screen Bad cam clarity when i compare it opp f11.It charges slows.Screen clarity is also not good.Phone is bit bulkier. Really the product is value for money...with good battery pack...tremendous  speed...good sound quality...good camera...ultra fast charging...handy too... Finger print reader very less responsive. Camera quality not up to the mark. Slow processor. Good mobile,good camera but did not contain slo-mo and speedometer functionality in this smart phone also this phone didn\\'t contain the screen recording and call recording function.three finger scroll screenshot function is also not given in this phone but still it is a good phone Phone becomes hang many times.Worst product and also worst Amazon because bi want to return it but my return order not accepted by Amazon. I will never buy any product through Amazon and my family members and my friend circle will never buy any product through Amazon.. Camera is okay. Fingerprint is okay.  Sometimes phone is hanging and still facing network issues. 95% downloading data is not working 100% working uploading data only. Battery is very very worst.  It\\'s drained quickly. M12 is totally waste. Don\\'t buy guys. Nice product. Worth money The battery is heavy and also used to get heated up at times..samsung phones are better than this model totally mind blowing mobile phone. extraordinary performance in low cost. There is mild issue like mobile weight only other wise fibulas handset. Had ordered for my parents and they just loved it. Camera is ok but battery backup is amazing. I have taken mobile through EMI options during dussera festival season..I am full disappointed with charges what was applied in the credit card as they were not showed while booking mobile so I am really not happy but not sure who has taken hiding charges. Very substandard product from SamsungBulk in size,software not updated,pathetic camera,no new features,no return policy.Absolutely disappointed To be honest reviewBest phone at 9000 budget , that too in samsung flagshipProsBatteryCamera is good as compared to other segments in this rangeConsSlow processorTouch sensitivity is lowToo heavy Cons:-Cheap processor, cheap body, cheap display.Pros:- good ram of 6gb and 128 storage in 13500/-. Good camera quality. Good brand value. 1st of all that blue color is awesome 😍. Other features are overall good as a normal user. Pathetic 48 MP camera and selfie camera too.Rest is all good.Fluidic display. Good products and very happyPerformance all good👍Nice oneSamsung is best I bought this phone for my mother Phone is good considering the price especially its battery lifeOnly drawback is its weight it is around 220 gram. But we got big battery too,So its managable. Battery life ek din bhi nahi hai, fas gaya ye phone le kar, 6000 mah battery sirf kahne ki hai, bina use k bhi bht tej drain hoti hai. Waste of money because of battery life. Face lock bhi kaam nahi kar raha, password daal kar hi open hota hai The Samsung Galaxy M12 is affordable, looks good, and has a large battery. for camera 2.5 STAR, battery 5 STAR, charger 5 STAR, OS SPEED 2.5 STAR, HEAVY WEIGHT PHONESASTA ACHA TIKAU It is value for money phone in turms of  entertainment and day to day use except side finger sence. Beacause when put it in/out  to your pocket unknowingly you touched the sensormany times. I liked the fingerprint censor,camera and screen. As screen is very long it helps you with online classes and learn better. It\\'s eye comfort shield feature is really helpful when you want to use your phone for a long time. इस mobile का कैमरा बहुत ही बकवास हैं कम्पनी द्वारा बताये अनुसार इस फोन का कैमरा काम नहीं करता हैं इसमें first photo इस मोबाइल ki हैं व second photo मेरे realme 6pro ki cilck की हुईं photo हैं mujhe ye product बिलकुल भी पसन्द नहीं आया। मुख्यत कैमरा जो की बिलकुल ही Acha नहीं हैं। battry is not good working vey fars decrise this phone have 6000 thousand mah battry but not runing in halp day very frst decrise and also haking problemphone evry time hank over all this phon is faltu dont buy this phon The phone is quite heavy if ur used to using a light one.... this is phone is atleast 3 times heavier than my previous phone. Camera quality is not bad, it is average. For this price I find that pros outweigh than cons outrageously. Good value for money but the battery efficiency is not upto the mark as what is claimed . It is still average with 6000mah battery . Battery drainsatleast  20% in 4 hours without any use. Rest all is good do far. Bought the 64gb ram and 128gb internal storage varient of the M12 phone and using it ever since.  Happy with the purchase.Pros: Samsung UI, battery life, display, camera, software updates,Cons: weight Camera is good. Battery capacity is very good. overall performance is good. Display resolution is also very good. The qualities which gives this device an edge then other smartphones with same price is it\\'s – *Battery life* 6000 mAh ,that\\'s huge also with quick recharge , quad camera with 48MP camera and 6GB RAM AND 128GB ROM which is way better than other smartphones with the same price. Speaker is not functioning properly.when call is put on speaker terrible humming sound ,no clarity in sound. Cannot play audio song because of humming sound.purchased / received this new mobile on 2nd Nov 2021.Request to replacement of mobile There is no 18% fast charging as mentioned above and battery life also worse....without net I will stay 1 and half days...USB cable not working properly while any think needs to be transfer from PC there have not showing USB setting as other samsung mobile showing mode of USB. So far it\\'s very good.  The performance, speed and lasting can be checked after one year. Camera is average, battery life very good, processor is little bit slow as other brands, display is good  but not too good. Disappointed as the camera quality was not at all like 48 mp. Plus, a lot of pre installed app which can\\'t be uninstalled by user. Screen glass quality is not good within ten days after purchasing this mobile phone it slipped from table and fell down screen was damaged and there\\'s no warranty for screen replacement,customer care is asking 3600 for replacing screen please improve your screen glass quality Phone performance is overall good but camera is of no use. Don\\'t buy it if you want to capture photo memories. Overall performance is good but camera quality is not up to the mark and can be enhanced little more. Sometimes WiFi calling makes it difficult to call and it shows out of coverage so it\\'s advisable not to use WiFi calling. Overall performance is nice. I have been buying only Samsung phone and purchase of this particular model made me to look for alternative in future. The display looks very dull even after adjusting brightness. I mean the typical  Samsung clarity is somehow missing in this particular model. Good phone and camera. There is no finger print sensor, other than that it awesome phone Excellent Mobile Only for one UI and samsung brandUseless DisplayBasic performanceLow camera qualityGood battery lifeGood sound in earphones, Bluetooth devices Pros- Battery life, compact, processor speedCons- Network connectivity- frequent error shows \\'Network not registered \\'. Camera quality is bad in night modeBluetooth connectivity taking time camera resolution is not good.It says 48 megapixel ,but dosen\\'t behave like that.sharpness and clarity missing.Display is fineOverall ok for given price point. Camera is niceBattery quality is awesomeSystem UI is goodRAM is just nice.6 month after use : it hangs alot even if we have 4 5 extra app on phone. Charger is worst, company saying fast charger provided with mobile kit, but it is totally bluff. It is taking 2 nd half hours for full charge. So, company to provide fast charger or pay compensation immediately to avoid this grievances from customers. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0At this price, fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality are very good. However as because it is a LCD based display , display quality is not that great. Again considering the cost it is good. 90hz refresh rate is not experienced. The battery life on this phone is very good and the fingerprint reader being on the lock button is handy too.The camera shutter speed along with the speed on focusing is not the fastest but can be overlooked if camera specs is not a focused topic while buying the phone. The product is third class, it doesn\\'t capture photo after focusing, camera focus is wrost and images are also not good as I was expecting. I\\'m literally not at all happy with this Samsung mobile. It also doesn\\'t have gyroscope sensor, you can\\'t play PUBG in gyroscope mode. I like it\\'s Battery performance and overall build up quality. Camera performance is also better. Frankly speaking, I could not find any reason in last one month to dislike it.Though, it\\'s a heavier but it is well-known for 6K mAH battery. Didn\\'t like the camera for the price paid, in this price or less than that we can buy redmi 7 or any others which gives more better camera quality, it has 3camera but useless of having 3 camera. Camera quality is like a local phone camera. Overall experience for using this phone is good as under this budget you received nice phone with massive battery backup though camera quality is not up to Mark which I believe but overall phone is good you can buy it. 1. Good quality in this price.2. Everything is monster and it\\'s great.3. It hangs many times, even when I don\\'t have any data.4. It\\'s really heavy to use.5. Face and fingerprint reader are slow. Very disappointed the voice calling features was terrible.....earpiece is very bad ...I was not able to hear the other person voice by putting phone in loudspeaker and when I exchange phone the problem was the other person on phone was not able to hear my voice -Front camera is poor.-Battery life is good for average usage.-Finger print - i wont say slow but not that fast (tht issues i guess is with all samsung devices)- the major issue is with network reception, you cant hear the other person on the call clearly Too much heat and mic having issues... our voice not clear to others... my suggestion go ro redmi 9 power. i purchased both. that is better than this. other this go for any one better I purchased it from 2 months ago from my savings for a good phone but it\\'s to bad and worst Mobile I suggest no body to purchased it mobile phone display was automatically off it  and phones is on display quality is worst and know service center was refused to change my phone The audio speaker is not working since beginning. Didn\\'t notice since was using headphones most of the times (Purchase Date: 2nd April).  It\\'s impossible to take calls without headphone or loudspeaker as the audio output slot is not functional at all!! Samsung please help!! Camera is good.90 HZ refresh rate. Smooth performance.Screen quality is good.Battery backup is great.Overall Good Smart phone. The camera is not good! I have Redmi note 7 pro which is also 48mp but has a batter camera!The phone is very huge it is very heavy and fatIt should be slim!!I didn\\'t liked it at all I am really impressed with the speaker sound quality and voice clarity during calls. The camera is also good although I have not had a chance to use it much as there is not lot of going out nowadays. Superb excellent deliveryNo damageAll over agin good and excellent100% originale product This phone is better than Chinese phone in the budget. No blotware,no hang, time to time updates, camera is up to average, battery life reliable, side finger sensor working good and all features are good. 👌🇮🇳 👍At the time no issues. This is probably the best budget phone, you won\\'t get a phone with such good features for just 11k, I got it montha ago everything is working well, charged it only once. Good one from Samsung.Good work by Amazon too for quick delivery . The phone got switched off on the 3rd day of purchase, Amazon service had come for Mobile inspection but did not anything after that. The phone is not working and Amazon has not provided any response about that.  Kindly return or exchange the phone 2nd day my handset dead it’s not working I don’t hav word to say I m been scared to buy Samsung’s  cellphone nowI m sorry to say Samsung Display quality is not good. Samsung s secure not working. Battery is good. Camera is good at this price. No gorilla glass protection. Always on display not available. Like. Awesome mobile with this cost. The phone started lagging just after 1 month. I don\\'t have too much apps and I never installed high ram consuming games like PUBG, FreeFire etc. still the performance is very poor.I am unable to pick the calls, the screen freezes.Pathetic......... Nice phone to buy with loaded features. But Battery is 6000mah but seems it\\'s gets exhaust in a day and phone width is bit wide. Other all features are good and work fast like finger and face unlock. Product is good for price range. Battery backup is good. Battery running up to 1.5 days with moderate use. But phone is having good amount of weight because of large Battery. Camera is satisfactory.  Display is good. Finger sensor good. Almost all features are good, but call volume is very low, this is really necessary, hope samsung will fix this in next upcoming versions. this one works well at this price point instead of its camera, camera is like we are using a 3-4k range cam, worst picture quality.. bhai thoda bahut toh awkat mein rakho isko..MI 1s aaya tha MI Ka 1st phone 6000 mein uska front cam bhi iske back cam se achcha tha Pros - big battery, big display,Cons- no net speed meter, no 3 finger screenshot, not clean uv many useless samsung app u dont uninstall it, if u using screen guard n back cover your phone is like power bank thickness, if u want camera then this phone is not for u Battery life is very good. At one charge it can run for 2 days. Fingerprint reader is good and fast which is built-in power button and this thing is really impressive and also camera quality is good with quad camera. So, at this price point of view the phone is awesome. The phone performance, battery life and camera quality is good. But this phone is little heavy to carry and big in size. So feel little hard to fit into pocket. Awesome productBest feature of this phone is it 90hzTill now no cons visible Love this phone. For the price this is the best.Gets the job done for a smartphone.And to top it off. Killer offers from amazon and excellent service by samsung. Like Good battery. Awesome display and camera. Decent performance. No pre installed Chinese apps and it\\'s made in India. Battery life not good. Finger print reader not effective. Phone is slower than a 3 GB phone. Camera not tested as not needed by me. Worthless for money charged 48 mp true cam is a scam, even my old nokia sybian phone can capture better photo than this. While zooming the photos, it is like a water paint and fully pixelated. So dnt buy if camera is your preference. Good product with good battery life..i bought this for my brother in nov21..camera is quite low quality but good enough as compare to its price ...overall its a good product bellow 7.5k and i am fully satisfied with product Helllo I purchased my new phone Samsung m 12 6 128 on amazon. but phone camera is very bad because picture is very breaked and and phone is right side is dumped so I give to replace order but yet to be not replaced my phone. So kindly replaced my phone on same Address. I purchased this for my mother. Previous phone was lg and need to charge for twice a day but after purchasing this feeling better because charging after 2days mostly. Need to see some more days at present no issues Hi Amazon,We bought this mobile, but seems to be issue with Mobile.it is Heating continuously..If possible, please change our Mobile. Worst Product... don\\'t buy this... cheap quality camera... not expected from Samsung... feed cheated.... have been using Samsung phones for 7 years..  never buy Samsung phone ever.. Hanging like every 5 minutes and when I get call sending a template like call you back or pre define messages phone restarting and over heating,now I realized to exchange but window not allowing me to exchange or return this item kindly guide me Its good at this price, its been a week since I have used it high end games work smoothly, the battery does not drain or heat up while playing such games, the only average quality this phone has is its camera quality. It should have been improved with the given price. I gifted the cellphone to my mother. She is a gaming freak and a gadet freak too. I guess it\\'s a must buy. I have stated using it.  I can give an opinion only after using it for some time. Good Packing , timely delivery etc is well appreciated. thanks.  Sreenivasan Bestest phone in this range of price ...my mom love to use this ..one con of this phone is its too 😶bulky. I thought it can be used as 😎DUMBLE😎 for exercise 😀😀😀1️⃣Fingerprint sensor 8/102️⃣Battery life 9.5/103️⃣Camera with this price brand 9/10 Some smasung apps can’t delete. samsung forcing me to use it. it’s really disappointed me. In other hand apple allows you to delete any app. even phonebook. and you can use third party phonebook. Display, Battery, Size, look, processor all Good. Camera needs to be better.Only phone and charger you will get. No headphone.!!!! The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The phone hangs a lot everyday for atleast 2 times. Then it automatically switches off and restarts. Touch response is really bad on this one. Doesnt even give the feedback of having 6gb ram. Seems less than 2gb Please don\\'t buy any Samsung, it is good upto one year only, then next month  you have to spend money at Samsung service center frequently.. for example yesterday my m31s display gone while watching movie, which is purchased on September 2020.. Very heavy product. Plz check actual weight before buying. Samsung states it to be of 221 gram but it was 265 grams when we physically checked. We didn\\'t evaluated phone for other features as weight of phone was itself biggest negative feature. Fingerprint reader is too good it working smoothly. Battery life is also good once in a day I charge my mobile at 80% it sufficient for whole day. Just I want some more features in camera for taking pictures by rare camera. Overall performance is too good for gaming. The Phone will hang too much. Don\\'t waste your money in this. Choose another. Because once you buy, You cannot return the phone at any cost nor you will get refund. In this case you will stuck with the phone. They will send replacement but every model will work slow. Phone was very good, it\\'s awesome and it\\'s an nice phone for this price and phone features are very good I got it for my mother to attend zoom calls. It\\'s been 3days, and she has not been able to attend the call with audio. All combinations,settings has been tried. Feel bad that I can\\'t help sitting from far. Can the service center help in Kanpur. Great deal. This is the best in the category. Fingerprint, camera and battery is much better than any Chinese mobile. Best Product in this range and not for heavy  drivers  .Much  better  for daily use  and medium productivity purpose.Rear  Camera shoots  steady videos and detailed pictures. Prosear slow display good battery backup good price High hai 7000 tak hota to thik HOTA Mobile good great product by Samsung.And Amazon services very very amazing 👏👌Actually my product delivery day is Tuesday but product come Saturday its mind blowing services I am fully happy This phone  , seal broken  , 54% charged  , Lots of fingerprints already applied  , Lots more ,Looks like Amazon is turning into flipkart Camera(slow motion missing) nice, processor goodFor app lock you should download application,Not having enough inbuilt like Mi if you use Mi you will be little disappointed bz at ds price Mi give more system and user friendly phone Poor internet catching. Lagging and hanging. Don\\'t buy. Poor assistance and support for warranty. Totally disappointed with this phone. Really disappointed after receiving the mobile. Over weight and there is wifi calling option no headphones no screen cover and case cover.. Bettry to go with redmi mobile Good mobile at this price Finger print slitly working littil bit slowAnd bettery life is goodCamera quality so good..48 mp is good .And products are in good condition. I booked 2 phone and i received 2 with good packing.. M12 is the worst mobile of Samsung, and if you went for its service center with any minor scratches or problem, they will say - It can not be considered under warranty policy.In one word they are doing a cheap minded business. They do not provide any warranty. Product is overall good. I used 6 GB RAM based phone earlier with 7000 mah motoG 5G model and this device M12 Samsung is lot much better in battery management compared to i5 and Camera quality is below average.  Whatever you click image got distorted. Disappointed with camera. Not good as I expect during charging getting heated and touch not work properly  getting hang also today I asked coustomer care to replace they deny as it 7 days replacement now its 8 days. I am not satisfied with phone . Overall rating is four because my phone has sound concern. At max volume, volume is not really high. Its fairly low volume and on video calls sound of the person on other side is not clear. Otherwise good phone! I loved this smartphone.i bought this smartphone in Rs.8500 only in great indian festival sale 2021. Battery backup is superb . 90hz refresh rate is good.phone charges faster than other 6000mah battery phones.48mp camera is soo good in this price range. Phone gets hanged though 100gb internal memory is free bought 1 month ago. Camera clarity not good expected much better with the mp it claims. Not lived upto expectation This Mobile is awesome . The finger print sensor is working good. It\\'ll suits best for buying a mobile to mother or dad.Perfect battery performance. Good back cam.It\\'s only for normal use and common using purposes.You cannot expect it for gaming. The display quality is really disappointing along with the camera. The built quality is average and it really looks like the the average budget phone. Not very excited with this performance on day 1 and feel helplss as there is no return policy as well. I like this product for its battery life ,finger print reader and camera quality. I wanted return this item but this not possible.why couldn\\'t not understand. Earlier i used to return the item.  Worst experience i faced with amezon It\\'s hanging too much.Audio is not clear in video call and mobile is heat up instantly.it is a worst mobile. I used many Samsung but it is worst phone The phone with massive 6000 mah battery give you ultimate nonstop 8 hour of gaming and loses only 100 to10% but problem is 15w charger which charges the phone in 2 hours 45 minutes and heating issues but all is OK overall good choice Received a defective product. Looks like refurbished product sent. Having audio issues. Faulty speakers. Receiver could not hear my voice clearly. Very disappointed with Amazon sending faulty product. Disappointed with the performance.Camera- pictures are not as good as 48 mega pixel Camera,  4 front camera has no use.Battery is goodProcessor is slowRefresh rate is true is words only.Light weight I ordered this phone 3 months before for my son. Till today me and my son is very happy and satisfied with this phone. Purchase was worthy and I vll recommend if budget lies 10000-15000 then go for this phone. Battery life is normal, and camera quality is very poor. Also screen touch is not that much good. So I highly recommend not to buy this product. The mobile hanged within a week after buying. I am not satisfied with it and hope my review will helpful for you too.. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Thank you  samsung  .This is my first mobile,  it is soon good to all the fetcher,  in my opening camera is need much better  other wise this mobile  is very very good .Thanks  samsung Don\\'t buy this phone. Many manufacturing problems. Mainly network issue. Internet won\\'t connect continuously for 10 mins in any network due to bandwidth issue. Also, seller is very worst. They won\\'t take return or replacement. Please avoid this mobile and seller Slow motion is missing from video option.Screenshot using palm swipe is missing.Battery backup is fabulous (1 and 1/2 half on a single charge )Dolby atmos sometime doesn\\'t workSamsung claims 48mp true cam but its output is similar to 8mp. The phone design and performance are pretty impressive. Despite being 48 mp the camera disappoints and fails to clearly capture a little far off things. I expected more but overall its a budget phone. The weight of the phone is a bulky one but can get use to it. This is best option for under 15k budget. It ticks all the boxes like storage, memory and display. Good built quality from samsung. Phone is Hanging very much even the software is up to dates and also the apps ,front camera is average ,phone is working like 2 gb ram after using half an hour and have to clear memory very time,not satisfied with samsung brand The overall experience was really bad as the phone is lagging many times and battery is not upto the mark. Do not buy this if you are looking for a good camera. Really disappointed with the product. I want to return the product. Phone is having trouble with some of its major functions. It was delivered on 13rd April and today on 27th April i m having major trouble with this phone. Now return window is cosed. Im feeling cheated first time on Amazon. Is there any solution... Poor camera results, poor touch quality. Specially the support team\\'s response. They are looting their customers by claiming false promises. Don\\'t buy this phone otherwise you will waste your money on that. This phone can\\'t deserve one single star as a review. Mobile  is get to hot during call, battery backup is very poor...now no any calling is happened ... defective pc...want to return back, but the written windows was not working during Covid situation in last wk, all online activities were stopped... Fast charging,big battery and good look... brightness is ok..sun visibility not that good...it\\'s a budget phone for basic functions and apps At the price of 11000 best budget phone, battery life is pretty good, screen is bigger, for movie watching its ok, Although the phone is good but I am not happy with the unwanted notifications built in it. If I closed the notifications some important part was also closed with it. Really monster reloaded but refresh time is slow and when you open multiple app phone get slower for a while. Battery is good but backup may be improved. Over all its a monster again from my all time favorite brand Samsung. Phone is upto the mark as expected. Pros:Battery, camera, finger print sensor, design and build quality are highly commendable.Cons:The image editing features is too slow to open takes at least 3 seconds.Sound quality is of average phone. Battery life is awesome.  Fingerprint sensor is mind-blowing.  Processor is little bit slow.  Camera quality is average. Charger cord is very short.  Fast Charger isn\\'t really fast. Don\\'t buy samsung M Series products....Board quality is very poor... U cant use that products after warranty period.... If u want to buy Samsung products please prefer A series and S series.... Am working in samsung service centre so i said. Totally loved it , amazing features and colour. Better than i expected , go for it . Phones lags too much, poor quality, not worthy, performance upset, suddenly gets strucks disappointed. Mobile charger.On first day charger stops working. Its really very disappointing. After checking, found the cable is faulty. Samsung should pay attention to this issue. This problem is very regular with Samsung Mobiles. Battery is not charging up to 100%. It is taking around 5 hours to get completely charged. Disappointed with product the way samsung promotes as exclusive on this and that Good 👍phone but face unlock not workproperly  camera quality not good but aspected this price range I think good deal.All over my review is that apartfrom face unlock and camera quality this phone is best phone in Samsung. Overall good phone having better battery life, fingerprint sensor is also nice camera quality should improve specially selfie cam. HD+ display is given could have given amoled display . Processor is quite low overall nice budget phone. I bought this phone 2 months before audio and video quality in this phone is very average.Voice call or video call the sound is very low and not clear.  My 6k rupees Motorola old phone has much better video and audio quality than this phone The display screen has good video quality experience. With side fingerprint reader it is easy to unlock phone and camera experience is also nice ,good quality photos can be taken. Phone has long battery life and with continues  internet use also. It is working fine until now. It\\'s reviews were good and it came under a pretty good deal for me. I will update the review soon about its performance. We did not expect this type of phone from samsung.Camera quality is very poor.Signal receving is very very bad...Then, why should we buy this product.Performance is very poorBattery life is the one thing positive in this mobile Everything is wonderful for this budget. I am very satisfied with the features.But the camera quality is good but not upto 48mp and also the data cable is too small .Other than that it is worth only for this budget. Definitely you can buy 🙂👍👍 The packaging was proper. The product was safe. Also, the product works well. Like due to quality of camera and battery backup is so good. But some problem is continue in Samsung phone like fast charging problem and same slow running feature A phone is an indispensable companion and tool nowadays, and I use my phone for all activities of modern life. The phone is topped up with all the latest features. Camera resolution is not good specially in zoom.Heavy.Battery is good. This was the phone I bought at the last great Indian festival. The internet has not been available since I started using it. Taken to service center several times. now they have replaced its main board. Never buy this phone. Display colors are too poor... actually very bad colours.Actually 5-6 years old Samsung J7 has much better coloursGot it for ₹8500 ready sell if someone wants it Camera quality ok but no photogenic software  which is very  sad thing to say. Very very slow response. Key pad doesn\\'t  have sufficient  spacing.  Very difficult  to text message. Contact searches  are difficult Very good phone for students who are attending online classed.Camera - AverageBattery - Good (6000 mah)Performance - AverageBudget friendly phone Been using this product for almost a month now. Great battery. Good and sharp fingerprint sensor. Camera quality is average.. could\\'ve been better. Processor also could\\'ve been a bit better. Very rarely the phone hangs. Overall a good buy at this price !! Average for low budget not good and no strong camera battery or others if you want for low budget than go for it...It is for price range 8500 is good other than choose some others mobile for upper price range.... Best Phone with good battery life allows full day of runtime while running heavy gaming applications.Decent Cam performance by primary lense of 48MP.Finger print scanner works perfectlyFeels robust build while holding this phone. Great product, my previous phone was a70, this phone is as good as a70that I bought 2 years ago Good allrounder mobile for daily use . Not for hardcore gamers but can play pubg no heating issues . It uses only 10% of battery in 1 hour of pubg gaming .but doesnt contains applock for the device its a draw back . Totally its worth for money Nice looking nice working For normal user its quit good, but who wants to use it for gaming purpose then its not a better choice because not up to the mark in this point.Getting slow sometime, but if i speak about its bettery life then yes, performing well. Battery is ultra super.. charging speed is also good however the quality of camera is third class ..super bakwass.. quality is even less than of 5 mega pixel camera .. this is genuine review but I like the battery backup very much so iam using this phone I have always been using Samsung phone, but after buying this phone I am facing many problems. Before buying this phone, many people forbade me to buy this phone, but since I am Samsung lover I never heard to them..it\\'s camera quality is very very poor.. Review after 7days of use: Fingerprint reader is really good and battery life also recommendable. But the I am not at all satisfied with the camera quality. And also a bit weighty. Overall it is nice experience. Calling speaker issue and its not 48 megafixel, below par than 8 mp.Dissapointed with samsung, please don\\'t buy this product, you will be deeply disappointed. Now I come to importance know importance Reviews.. Set didn\\'t come with Headphones and Back Cover, 😒 that didn\\'t expected from Samsung Major heating problem during charging This phone take significantly lnger time to process the selfies. And often time images are blurry and unclear. I am certianly not happy with that. But the mobile feels good in hand, it is lightweight and has a good shape. Worst phone. The phone fell from my hand the screen broke. I purchased it like a week ago. This is highly delicate and one shouldn’t buy it. Quality cheap too.. Not good phone. I was replaced my M30 , but it was wrong decision. This phone is not worth to buy, just for battery life. Not worth buying this phone.1. Very heavy in terms of weight2. Poor cameras3. Touch screen response bad after 2 weeks of purchase Camera quality is not goodBattery life is greatFingerprint reader is not as expectedNot good for gamingDisplay quality is not goodIf you are looking for budget mobile with good camera quality, this is not good choice. Hello guys,I am using this from last 1 month, it gave me outstanding performance for CAMERA QUALITY, BATTERY LIFE, FINGERPRINT READER. This phone have all best features in this segment. I had purchased it for Rs.12499 with 6 months of no cost emi. Everything works very good and OS also very smooth but if your a camera person ...please don\\'t buy this phone...selfi cam not good also Phone is very heavy and causinh hand pains. Performance also not good...very slow. Regret the purchase. Not sure why the screen sizes are increased like this... better to carry tab than this. I am using samsung from last 10 years. The latest one is just 9499. It can do more than any mobile which pricing 10k. Some issues are also there. You can not zoom 48 mp camera. Face unlock is little slow. Although it is a beast in all aspect This mobile fingerprint access nice battery life very good and camera quality super nice mobile I liked Value for money. I given for my dad. Best for aged person and less usage. Samsung galaxy m12 is a brilliant  phone under 11000.Big thumbs up. 👍👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍If you are looking best budget phone 📱 you should  also try  Samsung galaxy m12/f12/and.Rear camera 📷 is 48 mega pixels.It is also good. The RAM and storage are very decent for this price range. A large  number of apps can be installed and run. Camera quality is good. Display and battery life are excellent. Only con is that even with fast charging 0 to 100 % takes approximately 3 hours. Face unlock could be some more better for less lighting remaining all features are very good .. It is Excellent in sound with base quality. I m saying and recommending this product for purchasing by others also. Don\\'t buy this product. It\\'s totally waste of money. It hang and not responding  5 to 6 times in a day. It\\'s just 1 month and faced lots of issue heating issue battery  drained within a day by just using 2 hrs activity. I have purchased this mobile but within very few days display got damaged on a easy move only. Is there warranty to replace this one According to my view very flexible to open with side fingerprint reader and Camera Quality at this price its super 👌 Likes are camera quality ,battery, comfortable for smooth suing, it is working looks  like a which is available in15 to 20K .As of now I don\\'t have a any dislike , I am looking forward working likes as nowadays for many years. I hope. Fingerprint reader, battery life are not as said by Samsung. Touch sense is also poor. Opening a page is very much slow.l am not satisfied with the product.l advice everyone to not go for the product. There is no Samsung quality. Excellent...I do here recommend to go for this product through Amazon which provides very good service Overall mobile is good, but for gaming this mobile does not have the \\'gyroscope\\' feature that is very besic thingI really disappointed 😞 by this Thanks Amazon I get this bank offer and coupons 10k mobile working fine and smooth What is use of good battery life if Screen display too pure along with camera quality... decided and PLEASE don’t Samsung phone and with same price .... we can get good phone on other models and came to know they samsung is a brand with No quality ... To much difficult set settings. Not user friendly. Camera clarity not expected as per given spec. Proximity senser not worked when u try to set on speaker phone at same time Screen will off. Overall its ordinary phone. Very cheap quality product. I didn\\'t expect it at this price 😤 Writing this review after 2 days of usagePros - Better resolution, Nice build quality, Super back design which is sturdy and does not slip from our hand, Faster UI performance.Cons - Front camera is blurry sometimes Not happy with this product as its really irritating me to install so many apps like music player, applock and all. Since biometric lock is already there, it should ideally allow us to use the same for securing our apps as well. Probably the best deal in this price, could not find better deal even on local market This mobile is good for parents and old people. The processor of this is good for day to day tasks so don\\'t expect gaming. A decent overall package if someone wants to buy a Samsung device. Phone hangs, very poor camera quality, sometimes call does not get connect. I got the phone in 2 days after ordering it and it was awesome. The game changer at this price. It has everything new, the ui which is one ui 3.1 and battery is damn good.i wuse it for nearly 2 hours and the battery percentage dropped by 10% only. 😯 Good battery life, fast charging, option to disable/uninstall pre-installed apps. Phone is a bit thick and heavy to hold, it can be tiring if hold for very long period of time.90Hz display is nice but only adaptive option available in settings. It\\'s been 4 months and the Phone is running like a monster. Finger print reader is good.. Battery life is amazing and excellent.. Upto 36 hours the battery run with constant wifi on and using Zoom,google meet and many more battery draining apps... Rear camera quality is good.. Not to recommend from mobile device efficiency and price point of view. Hai, if are in the league of band made in Chinese good then opt in. Ps. Most of the material are from main land only if not made in Chinna tag. I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I want to say just one thing it is SUPERRRRRRRRRB phone. Its camera quality Is best and processor is super fast. Average Camera Quality ..Not 48MP quality .Front Camera very normal.Roughly 2 days backup without video/GPS ON but on calling and full time internet on. It\\'s a decent phone for the price it comes. Built quality is good, and display of 720 means the 6000 mah battery will long last. Good gadget if using as secondary phone. Gaming experience is average. Overall a good budget phone I bought this phone for my father. He is very light user of the phone. But still I would say, the most surprising part was the battery life, it is amazing. The phone lasts for four days on a complete charge. Got the phone only a couple  of days  back. Package was delivered in good condition. Camera is just okay. Battery life is good, uses ~30% if one is playing songs on YouTube for 6-8hrs. But there is no headphone in the box. Hence 4 stars. It has only 2.4Ghz wifi but processor is capable of 5GHZ wifi , very powerful  battery  life, it have some ads in Samsung interfaces, its have good  90hz display , camera  quality  not good its below  average Battery life is worst. Overall product is not good. Don\\'t Samsung product. The product is just awesome.. It almost satisfied it expectations!! Loved it The phone have lots of issue like auto restart and error msg showing \"Not register Network\" and auto shut down hang issue. Pls return this product. Really nice and easy to use phone with 90hz refresh rate and 48mp camera and 8nm processor thanks Samsung for such a nice phone for only 13,500 Heavy phone. Camera not so good. Blue color doesn\\'t look good... Take black or White... I took blue and now I can\\'t exchange as there is no option. Poor camera resultIts not loke 48Mp its like 2MpPlese avoid to place order of this diviceAnd not blue colour like seen in image show by amzonePoor result and worst of full moneyDont buy this samsung m12 by amzone There is no hands free with this device. So if you want to listen to music or see a movie purchase your own separately!! Or listen on its speakers !! I purchased this phone for my mom. For her usage this phone is enough This smart phone consists of many problems like slow working of operating system and touch screen is worst compared to other mobiles and getting some unusual sounds from mobile need some proper response from Amazon team to take the mobile back ASAP Camera photo quality poor,Mobile Hang problem too much.Totally wastage of money.Fingerprint sensor also slow.Totally wastage of hard earning money. The phone is not working properly. Not able to hear anything when not in speaker. It arrived late and now the return window is closed in just 5 days. Not so comfortable in hand for daily use  or gaming  very heavy and large although afterall of samsung so no worry only weight is an issue Mobile start working too slow within 2 days ......and also giving network issue .....but in that price best product from other ......always Giving feeling off brand ..... Battery  life is great.  Camera is also good.  Performance is  excellent. Nice sleek and  beautiful  look. White color  mobile  looks  extremely beautiful.  Overall  a monster  in true  sense. Worth  buying. Thanks  Amazon  and Samsung. LikesGood Battery lifeFinger print reader is OKDislikesSlow response rateCamera clarity is below parScreen refresh rate is avgQuite Heavy Nice product still lacks functions which come in other phones at this range Ordered this product as a gift for my aunt. It took about a week for her to set it up, after adding a sim we found the display and touch are unresponsive. Would love it if someone would get in touch and offer a replacement for this defective unit. A high quality product with high class camera, finger print sensor and camera.  Facial recognition is also quite good.  Great touch pad. Very nice budget phone, battery is very nice, fingerprint is also smooth.  I like fast processor. lots of love....thanks Samsung As expected the battery life and fingerprint reader. The camera quality is good. Hi guys ,Just two weeks back brought this phone .There is a software or hardware problem. What’s up is not working and even some application, some times it automatically gets restart ..Better avoid …Uploaded a pic for information., Such a bulky phone do not buy it. I bought it in blue color and it made me remember nokia 3315 bulky phone. I asked amazon apni dukan to return they also denied. Now thinking what to do. Overall, features like...it\\'s outfit is very fashionable.I really loved blue colour. Battery life is extremely good. Picture qualities are very good definitely because of camera quality. Not as expected, the voice While calling is not good, no finger print. Not satisfied. Touch screen is not working properly. When I open some app it\\'s opening some thing else. . Please avoid this phone. Perfect combination of features for a Android Phone. Fingerprint reader works perfectly. Battery 6000maH is another selling point. Battery life , excellent.. display is good for the price. 90hz refresh rate will not make you wow.. speed is just normal.. side mount fingerprint is ok.. not much fast.. Not a high end product....too long time it takes to load directories Value for money, storage and battery life is very impressive. FHD display is very useful to attend video calls, No lag or hanging issue. Altogether very good device at this cost Quite bulky and a heavy phone probably due to battery size. Touch screen is quite sluggish and unresponsive on some occasions. Camera quality is way too average. Didn\\'t expect this kind of product from Samsung. Already planning to sell this phone 12 month baad pata chalega kyoki wedhar ke karan bhi mobile me gadbad hoti hai baaris thandi me heng hota hai aur garmiyo me batry loss hoti hai. Unlike and mobile was shutdown ,please any one don\\'t purchase Samsung mobile , hanging issue and customer care care less answers and mobile waste Mobile is little heavy. Everything  else good if you are a normal  user The mobile with 6 GM RAM and 128 GB storage including high resolution front and rear camera are good. But it  weighs more than 200 gms and that is a big concern. Posting my review after 2 months usage. Exynoss Processor is the biggest draw back. It hangs and there is lag application launch.  I would not recommend this phone for this price range. Very Good phone  at most economical price with 6 GB ram, 128 GB Memory and 6000 mah  battery 🔋 Not preferable mobile. Games closing on its own. Heavy size, not a handy size. Writing this after 4 months of use, overall the phone is damn good considering the price.Pros:Good battery backupAmazing displayTerrific UI/UXConsCamera quality when it\\'s darkBulky Satisfied with the features till dateNo complaints so farBattery performance  is much better than othersAnd its actually a better performance  phoneAnd not that costlyIt fulfil my purrpose of multitasking - Good Battery Life- Good for people who don’t want a very high performing phone for playing games and other stuff that requires high graphics- Overall 3.5 ratings for general purpose use like whatsapp, FB, Mails and Calls Best thing is the long battery charge that avoids frequent charging Dont purchase this phone process is low as compare to others. As i have used from last 30 days automatic app closed not open try multiple time youtube also auto forward.Taking too much time to load an app.Dont waste your money. Samsung M12 it is very nice .....The Camera U Mentioned 48 Mp real but compare to other model of Samsung the 48 Mp real is not as much as good ....the working and battery back up everything is good ...but we want camera little bit improved .... Slow phone with sub par camera, just 48mp on paper. Also everytime the OS installs some junk apps while updating the phone, Samsung kindly do not distribute bloatware in the name of update/system update camera display quality not satisfy , and nor return option available, very bad experience Some time the beep voice for notifications not stop..it is continuously berping..after switch off it stop...it is a big problem....no one is attending call on Samsung cust6care ...plz solve this problem..i have left time to change this mobile.. Wrost phone ..dont ever buy it because after buying u can\\'t return or replace to amazon. The phone gets hang , dam slow and is the worst ever phone i have seen. Amazon doesn\\'t takes back bad products which they sell thats why they dont have any return policy in it. Camera Quality splendid!Fingerprint quality splendid!Battery quality splendid!Programs splendid!Best Budget Smartphone! All over good mobile quality is good as compared to price,Camera performance does not look like 48 megapixels.Rest things are good.Budget friendly mobile in Samsung. The battery life is good but the phone is havi it is not thin or lite weight.Normal camara and 48 mp camara is good but the wide angle and macro camara are not good the portrait camara is average. There is no night mod in the camara It\\'s a nice product in this price, good configuration. Overall performance is also good. Only concern is it\\'s getting heated on continuous use. I’m just a regular user of this phone and don’t find any such issues with the performance. I think the only complains that I have are with the weight of the phone and with the latest updates the speaker quality went down. After a new software update i got many issues like hang problem, heating problem. Don\\'t trust on Samsung product. कैमरा क्वालिटी बिल्कुल खराब है बैटरी भी अच्छे से चार्ज नहीं होती फोन भी काफी वजन है और मोटा है अच्छा नहीं लगता प्रोसेसर काफी लो है और जिस तरीके से कैमरा और बैटरी बताया गया है उस तरीके से यह चल भी नहीं रहा है मुझे लगता है कि शायद सक्सेस नहीं है Battery life - its the bestPicture quality - is very goodValue for money - excellent There is no injection pin for mobile and no user guide....we have measured 13499 for this handset and I guess that is it a sample handset ?????.....answer me Amazon......I will write review if handset works fine within return period...hope so M12 is really given me more satisfaction and return of price which I have paid. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Hanging issue, battery draing issue, apps crashing, apps issues in the very first day  phone got delivered i bought 2 Samsung m12 both have same issue Samsung customer care said buy from samsung official site Battery life and camera is good ..some person complain about phone performance I don\\'t know what they expect from cellphone around 11k go for it Camera quality is worst screen has no gorilla glass if mobile drops then all screen broken.. Really disappointed. Fone automatically switched off 2 times and even 2 days bot completed to receive the order.Heating problemHang slow problemI waste my money.Please do something exchange the fone or refund my money. Battery is very poorDisplay is worstCamera is very very badFinally don\\'t waste your and don\\'t choose Samsung productthis product can not be exchange any SellerPlease don\\'t  by this product Bought for 10299/- in Great india sale, now being sold on same Amazon for 9500/- or lower... Feel cheated to have bought in Great India Sale assuming lower cost benefit .... Samsung delivers as promised the Samsung M12 is definitely \"Monster Reloaded\". You get all the premium features for such a affordable price. I would recommend 10/10. I like the fingerprint reader the way it\\'s on power button n obviously the battery life is very good. Good but not upto mark. The phone is too heavy and it\\'s front camera is not suitable at this price.Back camera is fine,battery life is excellent,and other features are also fine.Sound quality is loud and clear. Overall nice phone. Need to upgrade processor for same price, some other brands give better performance then this phone in same price range.This phone lags too much in small things,Samsung need to give some effort on mid range smartphone. The battery life for this mobile is excellent. The mobile is little heavier as compared to previously used mobiles of mine. The camera quality is very average. The mobile does its work and the refresh rate makes the browsing experience good. Phone\\'s software and other apps were not updated and phone not working like 6 GB RAM. overall unsatisfactory phone. Not happy at all with samsung....within 4 month hang problem start with my phone...n to many times my sim out of reached.....every  2or  3 days I use flight mode option to restore my call service.... The Phone is an excellent Product. However I had to face a lot of problems in setting the phone. I would advise you to include the  setting up of phone, even if you charge a extra few hundred rupees. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I don\\'t like the product and also Amazon service the don\\'t return tha order..so pls don\\'t buy it...and the phone has some latest features missing like screen shot and screen recorder and internet speed..etc This Samsung Mobile Successful and very good performance. And its work system also very good and my use more working with business.  For game not to buy. Small game run good. And its running performance first class. I suggest that this buy. Please note that the phone is heavy as hell, credits to its 6000mah. Else everything is good considering its value, yeah don\\'t expect much from the display. The phone is very slow.Not a 6 gb ram model as advertised. The speed in reality is slower than a 3 gb ram version.I wouldn\\'t advice buying this phone. In three months time the mobile speaker has stopped working. Despite best efforts not able to raise a complaint through customer servive It\\'s a good mobile with a great battery life and a moderate camera quality. But the only thing is it should have had the fingerprint reader on the rear side of the mobile. But it\\'s cool overall. The best mobile with relatively less price with very good features. Display is poor all other features are ok, above voice mail notification cannot be removed and it annoying Only battery life is good and all remaining qualities are wrost. Also hanging problem.Dont buy this phone M12.so never buy this phone. Camera is only 48mega pixel only in document, in real it is euqal to like 8 megapixel camera It\\'s good for a aveage man . Camera quality is good. Also it has huge battery so one have not to bother to charge it again and again. It was a good buy in this range. In last the main thing is i got this phone 1k less from market price 😁. Camera is Ok . battery life is fine . fingerprint working ok.overall phone is ok in less amount. Very late chargingCamera not even worth of 2mpxl, it\\'s 48 mpxlby Samsung , night mode camera just scrap.90hz refresh rate also disappointing.Too much weightOverall disappointed. Mobile display quality not as per Samsung experience and voice quality is poor The phone is not recommended for regular use. people who wants a basic touch phone can take this. Camera quality is worst, when we get a voice msg in whatsap, the voice will be with 3x speed.. overall i dont recommend thia phone ProsSuper fastAmazing cameraHuge battery backupLiked the fast chargerLarge displayGood sound qualityConsSlightly thick but can be compromised in this price segment Adaptive brightness didn\\'t work properly. Battery life is not much as expected. Camera quality is poor. This phone is hard to use. Functions are very clumsy. Don\\'t buy this phone. 5Gh wifi band not available in M12.Please consider before buy.Its not highlighted in product specifications.camera quality is also poor I bought the phone on festive season.....Thought it might not be that much ok.But it\\'s best mobile I bought so far Bty backup is good.No support for 5GHz WiFi, No WiFi tethering.Avg screen, Camera and speed. Adaptive brightness seldom works.Value for money but other brands offer better specs. Samsung is always a big player in the marketSo as I accept this mobile it\\'s same6000 mah battery nd fingerprint scanner is markable overall a very good purchase.No any doubt purchase it... Stunning batteryCamera not upto the markFingerprints are fast but face recognition is slowSleek ui super smoothRam and rom 6 and 128 at 12500(introductory price) just awesome 👌 Product looks good. Battery back up good. Heavy mobile but not thin.Rare camera quality not good but front cam is good.Side button touch sensor.Head phone is not provided.C type fast charging. A decent phone with regular samsung features, nothing new or exciting, camera is not wow kind but enough in the price range. I chose this as a substitute to chinese brands. You can buy this but don\\'t expect too much. Customer interface is very cumbersome , one has to be technically  very efficient to operate this phone . In Rs. 10500 it\\'s good Product with 6gb Ram. But Camara And Speaker is not much satisfying. otherwise it\\'s fine. Battery back up Good one. Camara Result is not Upto mark. Headset not sent But it has problem like touch response is to bad when we use it in maximum brightness....so it is bit difficult to handle it in outside sunlight........ living this everything is perfect.....Review after using it for 3 months I have purchased the mobile on Amazon it\\'s delivered on last Friday no option is available to return mobile camera is not working and it\\'s not 64 MP it\\'s only 2 MP camera,Please don\\'t purchase this mobile and don\\'t buy from Amazon. weight distribution is 10/10camera  8/10battery  10/10fingerprint  10/10charging time  7/10performance  8/10 It is working good & excellent.Camera quality is outstanding!!!Battery life is very good !!!!No hanging issue.It is been a 10 days only form my purchase!!!!I may review after some months too .... It\\'s a good product with excellent  battery capacity. Camera is above average and processing speed is good. T As I am using this mobile more than one month, I am not give five star, camera quality is  ordinary, display quality is not upto the mark at this price range.Nabin Mandal. 48mp cam is nice although it doesn\\'t feel like 48mp and wide-angle is ok. Games on high graphics do lag a little bit. Battery backup is awesome easily runs for 2 days. Overall satisfied till now. A complete waste. Disappointed with the performance. Wifi adapter supports 2.4Ghz only and wifi connection works in limited range even my old phones wifi can catch signal but this mobile can not. very poor mobile from samsung..  infact the worst .Nothing  is goodPoor camera.Heating issue is unexplainable.. we felt as if we have kept our head inside the tantoor.Pls don\\'t buy. Phone getting two times in damage condition not good phone.when I told for money return Amazon facility say money return in Amazon pay instade of rupee.. Please don\\'t purchase this product... It\\'s too worst... Specially camera quality is too bad... Not even like  basic model phones Bad Camera quality. Slow working.  Its almost 7 year old performance phone Worst product. Battery  worst. Mobile release  more heat when using .second handmobile sold in festival At first opening, the outside packet was intact , however the cardboard carton was a little wet and the phone box was also wet . Phone however was luckily ohk . In this mobile the speaker of this mobile are wasteful because speaker was released very eriteted voice in this phone the speaker was wastefull Good phone..review after 2 months of use...battery like 5000mah....camera average...rest all normal...Good phone at this price...Samsung hardware main attraction...touch is awesome Nice phone with decent battery life.Camera is comparatively low in quality but it is okay. Battery quality is very poor. It is 6000mah But your battery drain very dragistically even when not in use. Camera quality is 48 mp but very poor quality. Waste of money. Simply amazing, one of the best phone in affordable price, amazing storgae, good camera quality, best battery capacity( observed for a week), Really a good model from Samsung, Thank you Amazon for delivering ontime during this pandemic Seems like refurbished phone I got ridiculous!!!!! Don\\'t buy this phone have minor problems I did mistake Working well. No problem. Battery is good. Camera is nice in clarity. Overall performance is also good. At this price good features from samsung. The device goes unresponsive so often when you need it most.The plus side is the battery life,certainly more than 24 hrs. It can give 48 hrs life if used wisely. worst phone,very slow processor, frequently hang, battery life is also not good, need to charge 2-3 time in a day if use internet.In totality it\\'s a worst phone. Weight is heavy and it is tiring to hold mobile in the hand for too long. But battery is too good and therefore one needs to accept, Nice mobile.only camera is not up to mark otherwise good functionalty. I don\\'t need camera because i have to do online work from mobile. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0यह फोन मुझे बहुत ही पसंद आया है और बाकी जो भी कम Awesome battery life - during summer we face load shading issues so I was unable to charge my phone so need to carry power bank but now I haven\\'t face such problems because with full of uses it\\'s given more than 2 days battery backup. Nice battery Standby capacity & awesome fingerprint reading sensor. Specifically when i take mobile on my hand i can easily unlock using power button fingerprint sensor.but the camera it doesn\\'t look like the pictures from 48MP camera I have used it for 15days and it\\'s giving me a good battery life. Rear camera is also good and I can say that it\\'s not for selfies., but average speaker quality. Overall performance is average. This is the worst Samsung M series phone. It is unresponsive, slow, the battery  drains out in a day. Amazon should not mislead customers by selling such low quality  products Only Indian sim will work in this mobile and the processing speed is low than competitors Issue with the battery charging, mob phone heats up and raises the alarm of heating up Camera quality isn\\'t  enough .. processing wise is good.. finally  I recommend  Don\\'t buy this pls be choose realme.. or something same budget.. Nice budget phone with all loaded features of high end phone Overall good package I 10000.Battery and screen Is very good and phone speed is also good.this is very good option for daily use. Best Phone👌👌👌Best for All Features👌Definitely Go For It👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Camera quality is low.Processor is good.A bit heavy due to 6k mah battery. This is worst Experience, After a very long time i choosen samsung..it Has very Good Specifications. But camera Quality not even equal to 2Mega pixel.. I cant suggest This Phone to any one.even though its showing as 48 MP My first Samsung  phone,but it is not up to the mark.Its negative  points are heavy weight,worst  4 GB RAM like 2 or 3 GB RAM,48 MP camera like 12 MP,Overall MI or Realme phone ki takkarka  nahi Hai.Naam bade or Darshan chotte. Battery performance is very poor.  I have to charge phone twice time in a  day As per budget the phone is not bad at all ..camera quality and touch not upto the mark . battery is pretty good overall as per the price the phone is decent . I have been using Samsung brand smartphones for the last 10 years and in my experience still Samsung smartphones are only worth the value for money, it is always economically better and it\\'s features are always awesome😍🤩 Batterry and fingerprint sensor is very Good. HD display also nice. Need to upgrade Camera Quality. Overall nice phone Real value of Money Phone. I Got This phone in only 8550rs according to price Camera quality suparb😜😜 cost effective, best ever battery lifedurablenot much unknown cache data stored yaa but, camera quality can be improvedface recognition to be improved rest is fine, u should go for it👍 It\\'s bad experience with this Samsung product m12.it takes more time to full charge.nd the mobile weight it is high.photo clarity was not good.and the main thing is it was not return product only replace product Satisfactory & meets my requirements as a secondary phone. Camera quality is very poor as like VGA. Very Blurry. And mobile quality is poor. After complaining also, I\\'m yet to receive the replacement mobile even after 15 days. Very much disappointed with Amazon. Mobile Is good as this is branded . But am facing charging port issue which is not good. In one month this such of issue face. Very disopointed the phone does not support “WiFi calling” with the 3 top service providers in India...Jio, Airtel and Voda-Idea. That is a deal breaker for me, Product looking wise nice but after a month there are restarting  problems occurring. Hotspot broblem occurred while sharing data to another device. It couldn\\'t share data continues its break signal continuously The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Good over hyped ,avg phone Working good.Battery lasted for 32 hours with hotspot and Bluetooth in active state.Camera quality above avg.Only concern is little over weight.Takes 102 min to get full charge from 8% of battery level. There is no lagging even when multiple Apps are active. You can shift between apps with ease. Battery life is excellent. Touch and feel excellent. Actually still is more remains to be explored - but till now experience is excellent. A fairly descent device.  But , slightly on a heavier side . Finger print reader not that good for security as it is less spaced and not good sensing tech in this phone area,rest camera is fine and good according to specifications, battery is good too. Front camera refresh rate is low.Bloatwares and lock screen advertisement. Ok phone and the camera is so so. need to update phone in this amount range as other companies are providing good hardware in this range. Super mobile... Getting too hang and heat, touch not working properly when I try to type something, when I asked replaced or return from Amazon within two days when I got new phone, they forbade me to anything, they replied it\\'s not in our policy. At this price you get nice camera and battery.oveall performance is very nice.its 90hz refresh rate you feel.good package  under10k. Finger print is fast. Screen is also good. happy with product. You never completing about battery. It\\'s battery life is too good and it\\'s fingerprint reader is fabulous ,camera qualities is also good but camera quality is not 5 star type it is 4 star. So, Overall it is the best  smart phone....SAMSUNG is the best.... Only battery back up is nice. Camera quality is not good. Finger print reader is fine not up to mark ........ I suggest don\\'t go on videos of you tube regarding the videos of this modelI would never buy mobile phone specially from any online stores Value for money. Good quality.Only problem is handset weight is slightly more, may be due to 6000 mah battery.Totally satisfied. Recommended you to buy. If you Tr y to return it within 10 days, you will not be given any option. You will always find- No options available now. Then 10 days are over. So buy any Mobile with utmost care. Once delivered is delivered. Pro : Value for money, great function like focus mode, audio quality is good.Cons: Bit heavy, charging not fast as claimed. Bad camera quality as well as display...don\\'t go for it..performance wise good..battery life good..not expected from Samsung like brand No fast charging and charger also very worst, battery life also not expected camera quality is also not much Touch screen does not work properly.  Most of the time the voice does not reach the other side. Mic is not working properly. Good phone,only battery  becoms very  hot during charging Phone is working well. Display is excellent. Overall good product in the price range All ok . Superb.Only camera and screen display is average I was never expected from Samsung m12 that his life is only 5 months then dad no battery charging automatically switch off on very bad. I don\\'t know what to do where to go for the solution\\'s  next time I will never buy from online The phone I received has issues with the display.. The colour quality was different (as seen in the pic I have shared).Thankfully the Amazon CC agreed for a replacement ,straightaway. Really a monster phone.. battery is really awesome .. nice built quality, nice camera, good display in this price ..for 6 -128.. Good but heavy, samsung has unmatched operating system interface but battery is too heavy. I guess they need to go for 4500 mah and atleast 18 watt chargee Fair product, not a great deal product or worth for money buy types. This isn\\'t playing good quality HD videos. Speaker output average Its thick not slimBack body made of plasticFront camera is not good This product delivered  by Amazon 21 march all features ok but this phone inbuilt apps lock not found. Inbuilt  apps lock please  provide next upgrade. Without inbuilt apps lock privacy share any other person Good phone for budget buyers. Sound quality is good. Battery backup is excellent.The only thing the matter of concern is camera quality not 48 Mega pixel as claimed by Samsung it is very poor. Phone is too heavy, it started heating my hand after use of 5to10minutes, comparing the display color is top dull. No i don\\'t like because of camera i have ordered but camera performance is too weak this is not 48 megapixel why u people cheat us by putting wrong information no very bad sound very slow cannot hear the other person while calling Quality product by samsungVery nice true 48mp camera quality 8nm processor with 6000 battery 🔋 good battery life,build quality is aslo good. Samsung is as usual known for good qualitymobile phones with excellent features for camera, battery life.But speed I think not upto mark as given 4gb. Samsung fans can for this otherwise try other brands as well. Totally unsatisfied  new phone do not attach to car stereo voice outgoing problem talked to customer care 10 to.es did not got solution but thanks Amazon for their support  clearly disrecommend samsung worse brand ever Samsung M12 is best at this price. Camera quality is quite good, screen is also almost full size. Performance wise better than other Chinese mobiles in market. Thanks to Amazon to deliver it on very next day. Good performance,Good sound quality for phone calls.Good front camera for WhatsApp video call.Good battery life.Bought it for 7.5k during big million sale. Just 10 Days Completed my phone Speaker Damage & Phone body is very hot I normally use this for messages and mail. It gives problems with automatic brightness control. It stays on low brightness unless I open notification drop down then it goes back to normal. W w it is good but the processing speed of this phone is slow and downloading speed also in his own while the data speed is above 100 mbps using this for some time I feel the fingerprint doesn\\'t work and phone get hang Camara and video quality is not so good.Experiencing slowness while using phone.Phone is getting hanged.. I sincerely suggest not to buy samsung mid range phones. I\\'m facing worst experience  with this phone Excellent mobile All over mobile performance is very poor, never buy any one this product  M12 totally worst phone camera is two very poor performance and some time hanged. Not available refundable option. Battery life is good but camera clarity could be little better and worthy could have been reduced. It\\'s a very bad product, highly dissatisfied.. Specifically the colour is too whitish and unreal display..  Won\\'t recommend to buy, instead go for M31.. It hangs as well within less than a month of purchase. The phone is a real beast the battery lasts easily for 1 day with continuous  usage .the 90hz display is not less than a butter  the camera is super ..the pics r very clear. Very satisfied  with the product.'"

voice call  some whatsapp  and mostly standbySo it is power monster in battery category Product specifications are not at parDisplay is below averageCamera quality is just okayIt doesnt support 5ghz wifi which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you cant removeYoure better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso I cant return this garbage of a phone as Samsung dont list this as a software issueIll have to look into installing lineage os and degoogle this phone before using it but thats easier said than done Just for name sake Cam  Battery are 48mp  6000mah But coming to reality it is poor The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes Horrible product A very satisfying  experience with the device so  farPros1 Long battery life  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming That said  the battery lasts up to 2 full days2 Decent cameras for the price Pictures are satisfactory but could be better3 Very responsive finger print sensor4 Good sound quality although dolbys impact  is not much pronounced5 UI is great and snappy Lots of customization options6 The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate It does make the difference7 Fast charging works fineCons1 The weight of the phone is on the heavier side  220 gms2 The display could have been a full HD  1080p3 No led notification light All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screenOverall a good package Not a good mobileQuite heavy in weight you will obviously feel it Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range Can definitely be used as paperweightNothing special in screen processor or camera alsoJust a marketing gimmick by samsungStay away At 135k we deserve far better than this Pros1 The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life 2Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really goodCons1 You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also the camera is not up to the mark2 The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothingThank youI hope you all will like my review This is Samsungs worst phone and it hs many glitches Samsung doesnt even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing Its camera is less than mediocre Sound quality is bad Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard I want to return this but there is no such option I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices Amazon is also allowing substandard unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information Camera is very poor though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp Its a real monster Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING Fingerprint works very fast Battery life is also really huge Those who are not in favour of camera quality theyre wrong camera quality is just awesome size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera Must buy product Really happy from it 😌 Once again no complains regarding anything I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1 Battery and Camera1 BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non senseI played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98 to 80 2 Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in IndiaIf anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this Look is average Battery life is good Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review This is an open challenge to Amazon Disappointed with this mobile PhonePay  GooglePay apps are not working properly Numbers visible only half and getting overlappedand were end up typing wrong Pin numbers multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issuesWe have tried to return this mobile but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about itPositive points • Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it• Battery backup 6000 mAh is amazing even after using it throughout the day• Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light• Large display having a size of 65 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings• 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth• The phone doesnt lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 8nm highend processorNegative points • Not made for hardcore gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics• The weight of phone is heavy• The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones• The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels• The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range• It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection  I am satisfied with this phone because of its camera quality and battery backup √ The phone is good looking but it doesnt support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark  48 MP is around 18 MP3rd THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged No handsfree in the box Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage   I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck Awesome battery life  and thats what I want  I am just using it for basic social media and calls  rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device CAMERA is average  My ipads 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called true 48MPMy advice go for 6gb variant as 25 gb is acquired by the system Overall  4☆ Heating issueCamera dam 👎 so badSensors issuesUsb isuueDisplay so bad its look like old phone not todays  generation  displayAmazone need to improve software  for check device  and all i think its not goodHeating isueee in phone phone take to much time for chargingSome time rear camera not work properly  for scan qr code and barcodeOverall phone like to throw in dustbin 🗑I dont  expect  product like this from samsung its to bad  experience  from samsung and amazone also im so sad for this review  but i have to do for everyone 😔 so pls dont  buy this product They have conveniently skipped mentioning it is not an amoled display while mentioning 90 Hz refresh rate Touch response is faulty on these phones and SAR value is high despite having exynos processor which also they have conveniently skipped mentioning This phone has 90hz display but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps doesnt feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images  otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage in normal mode you wont notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesnt seem as goodAbove average phone for the price I bought the phone for my mother Her usage is limited to making calls the phone stays idle all the while She had one more requirement that I shouldnt have to recharge it regularly Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone I was happy first few days it gave 4 day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything In 12 hours it would discharge completely I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said I see everything healthy in device I told even though your log shows everything right that doesnt translate to what I physically see I probably had conversation for almost 1015 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks I would simply waste my money I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost I recieved the phone today and observed that it is lagging a lot unlike like other Samsung phones Considering it has 6gb ram it should not be hanging at allCamera quality is terribleLots of heating issuesDoes not connect to 5ghz wifiOnly replacement option available for the product and not refund So choose the product wisely only after reviewing the feedbacksBad network quality Does not catch mobile network Dont know if I could get more disappointed by a purchaseThe phone did look okayish in the spec sheet But it is a very  stupid buyThe first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phoneIt is too heavy220g and too thick about 1cm to carry The display is the worst anyone could get at this price pointThe processor is reasonably slow Face detection is a joke Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge But the side fingerprint sensor was good Camera was okayish Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews I wrote my experience with so many negative points and it rejected Still I am writing the pros  cons againPROS▪︎UI 30 is amazing I like it a lot It is better than Redmi Moto Nokia UI Subjective▪︎Amazing battery life I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully chargedCONS▪︎Worst camera ever True 48MP is all bullst Low light pics are also worstFront camera is also not good▪︎Seriously No Slowmotion Timelapse  other basic features in camera▪︎It doesnt support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam▪︎Worst Screen resolution While everyone is giving Super Amoled display  Full HD display what happened to you Samsung▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick▪︎8nm processor is also waste▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless Phone is hanging sometimes▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and youll have a hard time with its weight Its like holding a powerbank▪︎15Watt charger Samsungupgrade bro▪︎Wifi only supports 25GHz band and no 50 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP 8nm processor 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks You will be disappointed I am very much disappointed The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon Amazon broyou too planned everything so well Good job Good phone in decent budget Display couldve been better  90hz is not true to my usage  Since i use op7T its clearly evident this display lacks the precision which it is said it has Samsung India  they call me daily to inquire whether i have posted a review and what star rating should i give to the phone  This has become a headache Dear samsung team  please do not force customer to write reviews and try to reduce the bloatware and unwanted app installations  I am starting to think MIUI was better than this Display  not that they said  averageCamera  average  specs doesnt meetPerformance  ok for normal useBattery  good Call quality  goodUI  Poor   I will not recommend samsung  this is not the one UI it was when i purchased M30S  Now this is full of bloatware and unwanted apps are getting installed by samsung store  I am puzzled on how to stop thisOverall  Very average phone  Better go for redmi note 10 or any other better phone in this price segment Not a value for money dela Good got it for 9999 decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling finger print sensor is good fast and sensitive Havent tried the face unlock display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price quality pics decent  note  Im a normal user of camera  battery is very good its really a monsterBad  depends on perspective  slightly big for small hands it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt  you can uninstall a few  slightly heavier when you have a good solid case  read as spigen branded Overall very happy to have a good  more than decent  phone for the initial offer price Being die hard fan of Samsung it is very difficult to write this reviewCamera qualitywhy say 48MP  when it doesnt even look like 13MP my Moms Samsung  M10s  camera quality and screen quality are far better than this phone Regret for buying this phone for such high price booked on first day of launch as it came from Samsung brand Generallyi go by reviews  but first time ordered on  launch day becoz of the reliabilityI regret for the decision i made Do not recommend the phone for anyone The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I dont know why Amazon is compromising on its quality to deliver  products  its evident nowadays Recently I have got Samsung M12 product on 7 April 2021 the exchange date is 14 April 2021 Now after 7 days this phone display is gone  there is a blur continously in the screen Plz do not buy this mobile I am facing poor network issue In my home others are using without any interruption Tried many things Asked colleagues neighbors mobile store person google and tried all the ways But internet is very slow The same sim is working fine in other devise in same location Even internet is ON it is showing you are offline when i try something Also took nore than 45 mins to download 72 mb size app Atlast i cancelled and came out due to intolerance I am placing return order will see what is gonna happen Very good phone Camera display speed very good Weight is little heavy  But worth compare to the price The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I had received this phone on 09th May 2021 For first two days it worked ok OK because this phone is very slowBUT on third day 12th May 2021 it was hanged very badly It was neither getting switched off nor restartedImmediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technicians visit which has completed on 15th May 2021Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacementIt was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospitalAlso people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred oneSecond thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKINGThird thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noiseLuckily there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star else I would definitely give that rating to this productThere is No Return Available and only replacement option is given by AmazonOnly positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt supportI am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021 means within one day after technician visitNow I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast OK level if not to GOOD or BETTER standardDear Samsung I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark Decent phone people say VGA cam because they didnt notice that the aspect ratio for 48 MP camera 48 MP cam option is only for 34 aspect ratioAnd yea its true that the wifi doesnt support 5G bandwidth  but over all decent mobile for decent price Got 6GB version for 11300 using coupon and credit cardThanking Amazon IndusInd and SamsungPosted pics are Shot by me on Samsung M12Those who dont believe they can ask me for Camera Settings Dont have slow motion and to much leg Pros1 Best Battery ie 6000mAh2 Good Back camera3 Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI I bet youll like it4 Good Performance I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I dont play games so cant review gaming performance5 Supports 15WT fast

Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark4Animations are a little bit slow5 Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slowResloved after update6 After every update they install MX Takatak Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime  I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brandsResult Best phone with all the latest features in this price range  11700  12500ImportantFor those reviews who are saying the phone is slow Got to developer optionsSearch Google for how to enable it  and then Set Windows Animation Scale to 5x Transition Animation Scale to 5x Animator Duration to 5x Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x thats why the phone seems a little bit slowUpdate After update Contact searching speed became very good The price of the product is OK as per the price bracket However it was nowhere compared to my old VIVO V5 Made a mistake exchanging the phoneThe phone is average Initially i given 4 star and after few months of usage can see the sound quality degraded and very feeble  camera outcome is not that much quality as they promised in d specs Samsung average phone at average price to meet out china companies competencyMy old reviewI have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR SAR for this phone model is 119WKG which is within the 16 range Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good 👍Performance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series Over all okay 👌🙂 head set wont be there which they mention in the items that they will provideOverall decent price 👌 I have Mo2s and this m12better buy m12 you get better storage ram camera and finger scanner etcrecord selling on Amazonjust checking performancewill give review after 1 monthoverall good on specs Except battery life rest other options like camera display  software are all useless If Mobile size comes under 6 or 64 inch then it will be preferable for elder peopleabove 50 age Over all it fails in all segments Micromax in 1 is far better than M12 Samsung is the beat I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback1 Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage2 Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube  Facebook or watsapp and usual games3 Look and feel is good easy to use4 Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity5 Front camera is not good but back one is good This maybe great for selfie  lovers6 Phone doesnt hang when multiple apps are opened7 Worthy product  for this price based on spec and qualityI have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference  Overall its a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery 1 Mobile is heavy2 Company has given 48 Megapixel Camera but camera quality is very poor3 Mobile is not slim and it is very thick mobile4 Screen size is narrower than image5 Never buy this mobile it is the waste of moneyAs per Amazon Policy they are not ready to return the product I have wasted my money on this mobile Genuine feedback after 1 week of usageGood thingsLow PriceBad things1 Battery drains very quicklymy old realme mobile was 3000mah battery but was getting me 1 full day and this phone is 6000mah Battery but drains by evening2 I am using 4GB ram and its very very slow and very laggingvery versatile very horrible3 Finger print scanner everytime i get error message could not detect correct impression try again4 It says 48mp true camera but i could not notice any difference from my old 16mp camera5 No cancelation or refund policy6 NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON IF NO CANCELREFUND OPTION IS THEREConclusionBetter to chose any oppo or realme mobile in this budget I bought this phone mainly for my kids online class during this pandemic We thought to connect the mobile with our TV through HDMI adapter so that our kids can see the class directly on TV When we tried to connect this mobile with HDMI adapter we came to know that this is not compatible with the adapter since its USB hub is 20 Dont know why Samsung configures the old USB hub for its new mobiles We also checked whether this mobile is MHL compatible or not but its notIf you are buying this mobile only for personal use then its a good mobile But if you are looking this mobile for your kids online class then PLEASE DONT BUY THIS The phone doesnt meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499 The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance There is no support for 5Ghz WiFi which is strange to find at this age of mankind The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppyThe only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose then it is fine and worth the money If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segmentAlways check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product Had some expectations Worst mobile experience I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back Such a bad touch screen slogging performance Nothing is good in this Very bad productI never think such a product will come from SamsungIt had 48 MP only for showPhotos are not clear On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one It gives very low quality photo againIt was my experienceI had bought by dreaming photo clarityNet work problem is usually Samsung problem here The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging After a long span of time say 3 years im back to Samsung Now Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market  I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it nowHowever  as before many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallableAfter using it for 3 months plus let me give my fair opinion1 Battery life makes me happy but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying2 Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro I dont see any better snap here3 Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here4 As MAH is more thr weight of phone is bit heavy I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed If it was in Silicon cover the Lcd must have been intact till now MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot5 After two years  I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement However i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways I need to put Alarm clock on i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so When a turn on torch i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manuallyAs off now i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement I will comeback after using a year if get time Edit1 adding on after using it for a few months the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly Please look after other ones waste of moneyThough the battery life is great the charge time is long Dont buy it The performance  drop is so exaggerated We cant switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum  Camera quality is bad as wellEdit 2Worst mobile I have ever bought Never buy it There are lots of bugs wifi calling gets switched off automatically Sim signal service are irritating Bluetooth is of inferior quality Lte settings change automatically This phone is great Writing this review after 2 weeks of usingBattery camera display all are goodand Battery is 👍  Here some sample of photos attachedPhone is little bit heavyfor that large batteryProcessor is good for daily usebut not for gaming  Phone 🔊 is also goodThank you Amazon Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product Ordered and received on the same dayOn the phone I am happy with it Have been using this phone for 3 days The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videosThe screen is comfortable No issues on the screen though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big differenceFor the price this is a great buy of course there is no snapdragon chip But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsetsCamera is decent As long as you are not a professional photographer  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics Some  pics are really greatThis is definitely not an iPhone or one plus But for the price it definitely is great Product is okayBut I cancelled order to get discount by paying for the same product by credit cardDisappointed that it was rejected Im writing this review after using few days I must say samsung m12 is great phone  in  budget segment  compared to vivid v17 and realme 6pro that Im already using  samsung m12 better backup  is excellent after 12hr using only 30 0f better  used but Im requesting  samsung  to do some important on all cameras  in next update  actually need some improvement  but  I must say in Rs10999  this the best samsung m12 phone if anyone thinking to buy samsung m12 please go for it but befor that few things Im not happy with phone is1 network connectivity need updated as soon as possible2 Amazon Amazon prime flipkart and eew more apps not working bugs is their3 YouTube also buffering after connected 6mbps speed network4 In the software I think lost of bugs are their need updat as soon as possible from my side I like it very much thanks samsung for this budget phone  thanks Amazon for one day delivered This phone is not compatible with 5 GHz wifi I have JioFiber which is having 142 Mbps speed but my wifi network is not visible in phones WIFII called to Samsung customer care and he informed that this phone will be connected to wifi which is having 25 GHzI am returning back this product Camera picture quality not up to the par But considering the price range it is acceptableBut no 5GHz band support Unacceptable in 202190Hz screen refresh rate does not feel like 90HzLot of lag is present Dont know if that is a software bugBattery performance is goodSpeakers are good as expectedOverall except the WiFi dual band support issue rest is acceptable in this price range Recently I bought this galaxym12 for Rs11k Overall ok But onething have to remember thst is thickness of the phone Its 10mm THICK Just like a brick in your pocket Overall dimension of the phone also big Hight  width especialy thickness Before i bought i didnt noticed the sizes of the this piece Thats my mistake too But u guys please concern about this review before you buy Otherthan size completly ok at this price I gave it 4 Stars for the features that do work and not because its a great phone Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing itPros Good Battery Life Great Fingerprint sensor placement Speakers are good as well for the price Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too Storage is plenty with Expandability Form factor I found good TooCons Performance sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick the UI itself is too laggy to notice its smoothness They went wrong in cameras too just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesnt mean its good The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy I would suggest to use a GCam mod then again I didnt find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850 Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseedAlso Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural at f20 this should not happen at allGet it for you parents Actually i brought this phone on focus to the 6 gb ram 128 gb storage 48 mp camera  6000ah battery Later on viewing the review of some customer i  was very upset  regreting myself But when i received the item and my experience on the phone is 100 satisfy with the product Awesome phone on this price rangeThank amazon  its seller partners once more thank for courier partner too which help to delivery my item on time  safty  Thank all Dont get duped by this phone The description of the phone does not describe wifi support anywhere Who makes a phone without 5GHz support in the year 2021 Apparently Samsung does This pathetic piece of plastic does not support for 5GHz wifi Dear friends believe me Dont waste your money on this phone This is the worst phone I have ever purchased It is slow and hangs often The network connectivity is very poor My Jio 4G sim which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone For watching YouTube videos you have to wait for minutes for the video to load I cant believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung And to crown it all there is no option for return You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert I dont believe it will do any goodAfter two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart I lost around Rs 5000 on this deal but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon In dis price u can afford M12 no doubtoverall excellent performance Worst product by samsungDont buy this mobileVery slow charging In one hour charge upto 3 to 4 percent onlyDisplay is too poor qualityDischarge very fast  In a day you have to charge 2 timesCamera is very bad Very worst phone Just waste of money and time I did not any support from Samsung team and Amazon The battery and charger getting heated up When I call Samsung customer service they said as you have purchased from Amazon they will not support Amazon team say that as this a Samsung phone you can call them They are playing games and I was completely cheated by them If you purchase from Amazon Samsung team no warranty for this product is only 7 days from the day of purchaseSo be careful before you purchase the electronic from Amazon you can get cheated themI have paid RS 11000 towards this phone Call button speedWorst phone speed it take at least 10 seconds to start dial once you touch the dial buttonFace detectionIf you put Khichdi mixture on gas  and simultaneously try to unlock phone with face detection I am sure khichdi will get cooked faster than your face detectionFinger scan unlockLock button amd finger scan button are same and stopped working within monthCamera qualitySony Ericsson 2Mega pixel cera of 2006 had better clarity than thia cameraWorking speedThis phone is winner in speed race if you remember the tortoise and rabbit storyMoral of the story Worst phine by samsung Hi Guys dont buy this mobile Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp Main camera has 48 mp But still there is no night mode continuous shots panorama options I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing  Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality herePhone is too heavy to keep in pocket also And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times  But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon Id dragging till the replacement deadline ends  They never gonna replace mobile also leave about returnAnd finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon Till now I used to buy in Flipkart I never had any issue with Flipkart I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff Sir I am really sorry however M12 supports 80211 bgn 24GHz This is the response from Samsung customer service when I inquired why not able to detect to my Router 5G Even 6K Chinese mobiles have 5G detection  so before you buy think and check as the mobile has very limited features The battery life is not great while it is 6000 and camera is very normal standard The mobile as a whole is a big compromise to the cost and is not a value for money product Pros 6 gb ram128 gb storagePlus 48 mp back cameraHuge 6000mah batteryLooks are pretty good as wellFingerprint sensor is on the sideCons Front camera is horribleScreen is not upto the markDue 6k mah battery it is little bit heavyOnly 15 watt chargerNo slow mo or other features in cameraConclusionIf you use it for general use storage binge watching it is a great phone but if u are gamer photo addict looks then its not worth itAlthough great phone by Samsung in this price range I bought this phone for reputed brand 128GB memory 6 GB RAMBut my bad nothing is working  It buffers every 5 seconds in each and every audio video including downloaded videosaudios Does not have 5GHz wifi singal acceptance It shows only 12 Mbps for a 200Mbps fiber comnection for 24GHz wifi signal Mobile voice network is always low Voice break always happens where as all my other mobile works fone All applications are very slow and crashes Faulty software even after updates Sound system including ring tone is very low Hotspot goes off multiple times without any reason Battery backup 1214 hours and takes too long to charge No support from Samsung Closed 3 tickets without respondingPlease dont buy you will waste yor money Very disappointed single band wifi doesnt support 5ghz WIFI band My 5years old Lenovo k4 note mobile able to connect 5g wifi  Future is 5g But this mobile not even supports to connect 5g wifi network I bought Samsung Galaxy M12 Initially the mobile worked good but for the past 34 days the mobile is geting heats up even without using and while charging it hets heats upSince this mobile carried 1 year warranty for manufacturing device and 6 months warranty for inbox accesories including batteryI request Amazon or Samsungmanifacturer to replace the said mobile at the earliest The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Battery life has just blown me away impressively A great screen and a good processor I play heavy games on it Im just loving it so much 90 herts refresh rate at this price Feels even better than my one plus 7 pro and I feel no difference between this and my s21 ultra ConsCamera is averageDisplay dosent feel as smooth as 90 hertz it feels just like normal displayBattery life is ok but not as per 6000 mah only last 15 days with moderate usageAlso samsung does not provide any back cover with this mobile so if u buy this mobile do purchase a backcoverProsCustomisation of samsung is goodlot of themes to change the look of your mobile screenBuit quality is okSound quality is goodFingerprint reader is fastDont trust Youtubers who are just marketing this mobile for sake of moneyThese people are biggest frauds Absolute delight for a budget smartphone Just ordered it yesterday and got it today within 24 hours It has it all 6gb RAM 128gb memory Further two sim slots and a dedicated mem card slot Its got a 35mm headphone jack as well Also its got its own 15w fast charger in box That is amazing Its MRP is 15499rs but was in sale in Amazon for 12499rs A further 10 discount on SBI credit card so deducting 1249rs and another discount on EMI deducted another 440rs and finally got this beast of a phone for just 10803rs Now isnt that something Really happy with the purchase as its for my dad He too had something to smile about amid this deadly pandamic Thank u Samsung and thank u Amazon No need to underestimate exynos 850 with 90Hz refresh rateit’s not disappointed me I bought it as second phoneI use iPhone SE 2020With normal use more then 48hrs still 44 battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it’s so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999 with ICICI credit card offerIt’s worth buying it’s far better than other MI with same price 1099912999 in 4GB 64GB  as Samsung don’t irritate with adds and also more secured I got this M12 4  64 gb and 6000 battery as an upgrade to the M01 Core 1  16 gb and 3000 battery phone in the hope that it would be better  BUT1  battery despite being double the size does not last any longer  5060 after only1 day of light use I dont do any social stuff only 35 talks and 13 messages per day2 the ringtone and message notification choice is very poor  had to import from the old phone3 could not download ringtones directly to phone but this may well be more of a problem related with Google4 software is not friendly even after 1 full day of struggle have not been able to locate  access storage card5 was very happy with the 1  16 gb in my earlier phone and never had memory usage beyond about 60 but this guy eats up more than 2 gb out of the 4 gb RAM even to start with even after i have uninstalled most of the apps6 one of the reasons of purchasing this was for its USB teethering which works fineBring back the good old button phones with proper software as 15 years back and with some improvement in screen  pixels and get rid of the bloatwareThink Look feel and finish of the phone is good and up to the standards of Samsung I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup This meets my requirementPros Fit and finish is very good Good battery backup Performance is good with fast response Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant Responsive finger printing sensor Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls Clear voice callingCons Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use The screen is HD only Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode Only can be played in 1080 p resolution No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work No Corning Gorilla class Screen is prone to scratches without cover Sound is below average for music listeners Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screenConclusionOnly go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup Not worth for entertainment purpose I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them It’s a true calling phone  I gifted my mom this phone in November 2021 and got a better discount for 64GB Overall it is good even i feel the size is big but its not that broad while holding it in your hands Screen quality is good Camera performs really well in daylight in low light it suffers a bit and pictures are not that clear and color is also not that accurate Battery is very good it goes for more than a day and half As usage is offcourse not that much but considering the price i believe this is a good choice Samsung has some bloat ware which you can avoid by unchecking the boxes while setting up at the first time or delete the apps after your first setup Rest no major complaints charger is not turbo charge but it does it work as expected Thx This phone is amazing for the price Phone runs smooth considering its a Exynos 850 Octa core processor I like the 90Hz screen and I keep it ON all the time  The fingerprint recognition is extremely fast and reliable It has a decent camera the battery is long lasting The only deal breaker is that it doesnt support 5GHz WiFi Android 11 with One UI 31 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully I havent seen a single ad on my device and I have been using it for almost 3 weeksIts the best budget phone for the features you get Doesnt look or feel cheap So far I ve no issues regarding the producr quality and deliveryit was gudfurther comenting after using the product for a week or sobut as revealed above in the picturesI think I ve got a used or already opened productI mean whenever I ve bought the product from the storeI ve got it well packed and sealedin a transparent plastic coverbut hereit is without any covering or sealThats why our family never likes to buy such stuff from amazonflipkart is best for electronic items and gazettes The build feels flimsy and cheap I got one with a bent display Unfortunately I never realised this defect until I went to pick up a back case and it wouldnt fitBack at the Samsung service centre they said it isnt covered under warranty and I shouldve returned it at the time of deliveryCamera is nowhere close up 48MP as claimed pictures clicked with it are mediocre to say the leastThe only saving grace is the decent battery lifeIts a good phone to stay away from though This phone is mostly suited for multimedia video internet office workPros1 Good battery 2 Connectivity 3 Knox Security 3 Design 4 Pricebecause samsung mobiles are costlier 5 Camera 6 Durability 7 Side mounted fingerprint 8 Quick finger print reading 9 Display although its a tft panel but picture quality is quite impressive 10 Type c 11 Fast charge 12 UiCons1 Heavy weight 2 Quiet thicker 3 Processor heating issue sometimes heats up without any reason maybe because of background process 4 Ui lags could be more optimized 5 Display samsung could have given atleast ips panel 6 Charger15w charger is not sufficient for a 6000mah battery 7 Because of ui and processor the battery service becomes very bad which could be good although I am Samsung user for longest time and despite some negetive reviews I say best value for money Only downside are its heavy but you get use to it and the screen quality Yes side by side my other Samsung its a let down but of its own its absolutely fine So if high quality OLED is must for you then get the one of the other modelsRest no hang issues does not heat brilliant battery as a backup phone on extreme power saver mode it lasted over 5 days I got it delivered yesterday So these are my first impressions after initial setupSizeThis is a huge phone So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed If you need to use it single handed often better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesnt fall out Or go for a small phoneSpeedIt is a bit slow but you can get used to it For the price range it seems to have a decent performanceAudioThis phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but thats only for bluetooth or other audio devices Not for the phone speaker Which is kind of a shame But the audio is not badVideoScreenBlacks are not exactly black But again for this price you shouldnt notice those thingsColors are brightThe phone is country locked So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulativelyI have not tested the other features like camera fingerprint sensor etc Will update as soon as I do This phone comes with a ton of garbage Apps pre Installed Samsung appears to be partner with IronSource which is a mobile app advertising company and they will keep bugging you to install tons of non sense apps Over 10 apps were installed on my phone without my permission or without me asking or agreeing to anything I did not expect this from Samsung phones I know this is the case with most chinese phones such as Xiaomi but figures even Samsung comes with such Adwares I wouldnt have bought this phone if I knew it was an Adware phone You have been warned I was looking for a budget phone but didnt want to exceed 10k mark And eventually I came across this model which was under discount It was for 9499 and just ordered it right away I dont have to tell you guya about samsung The processor is more than capable of handling day to day task with ease The best part is its battery It lasts 2 days easily And the camera is good enough to take photos and selfies Its a win win Thanks amazon for the sweet deal 161221Rereview after one week of usage  learning the product better I recall my review on121221Good value for money  After learning the product and its  features I find my choice is worthI have no idea how the picture quality is coming different

ehausts soonerFingerprint reader   not always recognising perhaps the narrow finger print sensor limitationThis is disappointingI encourage you go for a better option than M12Thanks Good one Serves the purpose Good phone in budget Powerful longlasting battery A bit bulky and a bit slower compared to higher mid range phones considering 6GB RAM but you can turn off the animations by activating developer mode to make it faster Still very few apps r a bit slower but that is quite acceptable as it doesnt irritate Getting 6GB RAM for INR 11500 is awesome It is not that slow also Camera is good but shutter speed is slower Hence u need to be very steady while clicking pictures in low light else they turn out to be shaky Nonetheless a very descent camera in this range Very difficult to get 6GB RAM Samsung in just 11500 Overall happy about this purchase Good if u want a phone around 10K Much better than simply spending 2030K for few added features Good if u want a secondary phone for office use checking emails etc Good for kids online classes Sturdy enough If u want non Chinese phone and r getting 6GB RAM in 11500 nothing like it Just go for it No regrets Loving this phone Packaging  Bad Though the item was fulfilled Amazon After few days of usage okay phone New softwareThe battery does not feel like 6000mah last 2428 hours on low to just midlevel usageA heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating while chargingThe overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition  I have the 6GB128GB variant and this User Review is on this model  If you are a NORMAL User like mewho does not play any Games or doesnt use the phone camera muchand just use it to phone call binge some movies or TV Shows or listen to some quality music then this phone is EXCELLENT for Usage Go for the 6GB128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system The display is good for viewing too not too bad PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE1 Android 11 out of the box ONE UI CORE 31 is awesome and simplistic2 It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference3 The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you wont even notice anything4 Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good5 Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful6 The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtubeThe charging time is worth it for the battery duration This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14 which is great The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations A GREAT FULL ON PACKAGE FOR A NORMAL USER I have focused only on deficiencies of service and breach of commitment of your organisation It may be noted that yours is a service organisation as defined under various statutes of Indian law You are obligated to be abide by the Indian laws Accordingly a customer has every right to question deficiency of services rendered to him in meeting requirements of consumer durables You cannot impose any restrictions on the comments Your guidelines are may be for your internal administration My comments are neither profane nor obscene I have only expressed my anguish and helplessness in not getting redressal of my grievances Its very bad that the sound in my phone is not working in just less than 1 month of purchase We have warranty and Samsung may rectify the issue but who is responsible for the trouble we faced for two or three days Samsung slowly going down and they can lose market share if they do not take an action on sellers who are selling defective pieces 1 is the highest score that I can give but this phone is deserved for 0 or less Superb Great speed and photos clarity Loving  Battery last 100 charge using since 2 days Yet at 23  Banking  payment security 👍 Camera 😘🥳 Speed ❤️❤️ All quality of phone  as name Samsung is Enough 👍❤️❤️❤️ Brand is Brand Price range 👍🥰🥰 Finger print sensor 💪🏃⛷️⛷️⛷️superb I will rate phone for this price range 95 As only 2 colour options available This phone is not listed on Exchange models while buying a new phone which means Samsung has delisted its own product Thats how Junk this product is for Samsung Amazon says exchange is listed by seller We buy from Amazon and not Samsung Add some more money and buy better products then electronic junks on Sale especially Mobile PhonesSale period defective and faulty units are rolled out otherwise a new product cannot have problems within a month There are only 2 buttons in a smart phone and that also most important one goes bad or was missing parts You will waste money even in warranty  they charge pickup drop as travelling 10kms during covid and wasting half day in queue is a disasterThats why Samsung sales suffer in Mobile phone marketswithin 20 days the fingerprint scanner button stops working initially looked good it seems they are reselling used phones which can work until return window is closed Amazon has zero liability post return window and they dumped junk Overall the phone is goodhuge screen size and battery life is superb However I have been facing issues with the performance of the phone At times it runs slow inspire of having just the basic apps installed There are also instances where when I have to click the send button which in some apps is located on the top it automatically takes me to another appThe only way to solve this issue then is by restarting the phoneand this happens on a daily basis I have tried reformatting the phone to resolve the issue but it still remains Also the colours of the photos arnt as dynamic as compared to the Samsung S10 Its like a pure Samsung stock Android phoneEverything is customisable its easy to use no lags or glitchesGames run smoothly COD  Asphalt 9 etcCall Quality is goodThere is no wifi 6 feature  not everyone has wifi 6 at home yetOverall a great simple phone must buy Just Rs 10000 In an affordable range this is a good phone to purchase Loved the way it performes with its special features like 90hz display speed 6000mh battery and decent camera quality If someone compares it with high budget phones and criticize then for them better to go expensive Overall its a great budget phone 📱 The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Tik tik soung of plastic coming from

for extensive useRecommended I would say its a decent mobile for the priceBattery is outstandingDisplay could have been betterCamera is decent and obviously cant expect more for the price90HZ really makes this phone special5g is not available thats kinda disappointingThe phone is also kinda heavyOverall a mediocre mobile phone for the price After having used an Mi A2 for about 2 years this phone was a step down The prices are similar and both phones are 4G64GBFound this samsung phone thicker heavier and slower UI is a bit sluggish Clear chat on whatsapp is almost always slow it was very quick on Mi A2 Googlepay PIN keypad does not render properly some numbers are cropped A2 has dual speakers with better sound and a qualcomm processorThe pros of M12 are  display is nicer the battery is better and the camera quality is better dont like the auto play of videos in camera app havent found a way to turn it off yetIf I were to choose between the two would go with Mi A2 lighter sleeker faster better sound Wonderful product Power packed Very handy Easy to operate Light weight Value for mon ey Excellent phone I have ever come across Powerful battery lasting very long between recharges I used it for whole day still battery dropped very little Amazing No heating  up of battery even after long continuous usage Very sleek and thin design Large RAM  and ROM Delivery by Amazon was on time Overall five stars without any hesitation Purchased mobile on 12th April 2021 IMEI number blocked on 20th April 2021 Enquired with Amazon they just simple told replacement period over not able to return the itemAgain enquired with Samsung authorized service centre they told its a defective product please discuss with amazon customer care they only able to replace the itemIf this product is purchased from Shop offline  maximum 14 days validity for replacementNow need to change the mother board it will take minimum 15 days myself helpless from amazon Please try to avoid the purchase from amazon No doubt it is a good smartphone but I was a MI user before and now facing some problem and some features are missinghere are my reviews on M12Bettery backup is best camera quality normal but front camera is good Screen size is very big for your pocketBrightness is harmful for eyes in night eyeprotector is useless you can add only 3  fingerprint for lock and sensor is wrost place at a very odd position silence key is missing 4 camera is a myths 48mp camera also a myth  for MI user no magnitometer it means no compass for North South  working  When put earphone no icon show at above you cant know plugged in or not power button doesnt off the flash light 3 finger screenshot not working here Ctype charger so you have to take charger everywhere OTG not supported  heavy weight Camera have very limited features like no timelaps video option no grid view no screen focus option  It is a good phone if it will your first phone then its OK but if you are MI user then in my opinion dont go for this  Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost Rest time will tell But so far everything is just perfect Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side but I think that makes it even more durable and solid And Rs 1000 off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake Forget other brands Need not say anything else Totally impressed Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe even though she was using an IPhone 6 S And it has been mentioned on the box that it is manufactured in India Another plus point One can go for it with eyes closed if budget is around Rs 10k approx If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered Happy shopping If you ask me the phone worth it if you are looking for 5G in Samsung brand With a couple of great specks like Samsungs FastestMonster equipped with the blazing fast Snapdragon 750G processor It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videosCons though Super AMOLED InfinityU 66” display gives a truetolife to mobile indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one At last even I don’t like the inscreen security as it would not work as expected that maybe I have not used to it since I am trying 1st time and I am blind person though The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0🤡Good camera 🔴Nice Build Quality and Excellent Ram Management 👀Performance of 6000🔋 Mah Battery Life For 2

the skin Im going to install a custom rom after a yearI bought it for my mom she doesnt know how to protect her privacy and data and Samsung is exploiting it ShameI disabled these appsin photo I use

Installing Google Apps takes a little bit of timePros1 Good and stylish Design2 smooth User InterFace3 Animations while calling are very descentLast but not Least At this price This is the best I saw I know its so many complications but its the best mobile at this priceThanks It took me an hour to set up the phone as all the pre installed aps were updating one after the other making the phone lag After setup I had to uninstall all the unnecessary app in order to ensure smooth running of the phone Each time I try and install a low graphic game the phone starts lagging The RAM is incapable to handle any low end gaming  The phone is very bulky and the hands start to hurt if youre watching any video content All in all its not what I wanted it to be Thumbs down This is by far the worst phone from Samsung I upgraded from old Galaxy on7 pro to this one because it promised better OS better screen refresh rate better storage and better camera quality But to my dismay none of these is a wow factor in this phone except for battery life The phone hangs every 510mins with only 2 apps running The screen response rate is pathetic and camera quality below par not sure what they mean by 48MP camera Dont take this phone even if someone offers it to you for free Its a headache more than a utility I would urge Amazon to bring down such a pathetic product from their website because it will spoil their brand name as well I took this mobile for the battery performance and it was one of best phone i ever seen last month it was taking upto 2 days to drain the battery then after one update it became worst it is taking only 20 hrs to drain complete battery and during night time also it is taking around 25  battery before update it was taking hardly 1  battery in night timesworst part of the software it is not even showing which app takes more batteryWith the latest update the battery and phone performance got very goodCamera is improved a lotauto brightness setting is still take lots of time to settle sometimes it does not works need to adjust manuallyOverall best phone with price point Got this phone for my dad who loves YouTube and watching newsPros Great battery life need charging once in two days with moderate use Supports fast charging No Androidware thus very smooth UI and no lag excellent 4 camera in rear and brilliant front facing camera Runs on latest Android and processor is quite peppyCons Slightly bigger in length and little heavy compared to others Future Android upgrades not clear Not 5G enabledTips I got this phone under 95K so wait for the right deal Good phone for average daily use I am slightly disappointed as wifi calling feature is missing My old M30 had wifi calling two years ago Also the call volume is very low I have to press against my ear to listen to calls Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 65inch HD Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram For some reason the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre Also the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube Despite the high refresh rate and HD resolution the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset Simply you better to skip this phone I break my old screen so suddenly I need to buy I brought this because I get it in good price but after I receive I realized its simple useless 🤣 my old 3gb ram phone I brought in 2018 100 times better than this its easily struck most of time touch doesnt working screen just break because I sleep on it you cant play pubg in it no games you cant use much outside in summer or do work much its easily shut down phone easily over heat many problems  people who need phone for simple thing like calling watching YouTube better to buy this  Processor is good and all the apps works perfectly doesnt hangs multiple apps could run without abruptly closing or need to close Best for people who dont want to make use of heavy apps like snapchat Camera quality is okay not so good when compared to M21 But looking at the cost of the phone this feature is justified Supports normal and wifi video calling without any issues Speaker sound is okay same cost factor Two features which I feel are thereal drawbacks  Finger print sensor is from the  side power button which is just below the volume button so you need to press it very carefully else it asks for phone restarting or switching off Second is not a real major one but the phone is very heavy in weight Battery life is okay you may continuosly watch movie or videos or use phone for 68 hours takes 2 hours for full charging Phone gets heat up in 115 hours of continuous use Display is good Face ID works better than finger print Call recording and voice calling are clear Have port for ear phones Hotspot feature is okay because phone started heating up when I turned hotspot on No network issues with either of the nano SIM To be honest i was totally skeptical whether i should buy this phone or not  seeing so many negative comments I took the risk and bought itAfter using the phone aggressively for 2 days i must say as i read from the reviews that this phone Hangs on operation which is totally FALSE Phone totally works fine Having a refresh rate of 90Hz the phones doesnt show any delay the UI is smooth battery is quite strong  Using aggressively at max only consumed 46 of battery in two days discharged from 100 to 54The only thing that will disappoint you is its Camera Which works like a 68MP cameraMacro shots are not that detailed eitherFront camera is just like having a 23 MP cameraSamsung should have uplifted camera quality when they mentioned it with 48MP cameraThis phone will disappoint you in terms of camera qualityRest the phone just works very well in terms of other configurations This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display  Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didnt  They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos But still this is the best phone under this budget Better that A21s of Samsung  Its the best 10k budget phone now Dont get confused with f12 its just same as M12 Awesome budget phone with all the features that is required for daily use like 6000 mah battery which last upto 1 day after internet serving watching videos listening music and lot moreScreen resolution and screen size is really well in this budget and you cant expect better than this within this budgetProcessor is also good for normal and average use its not made for playing heavy graphics game like PUBG COD Asphalt etc You can go for it if you are looking for something with a decent spec and long lasting qualityIm a samsung user I am using samsung since last 9 years and I can claim that samsung gives the best quality product amongst all the other brands except AppleCamera perfomance is really well as per 48 mp The only thing is its bit unstable in night time You may require some extra light for taking pictures in night Too good too purchasePROS1 CAMERA fantastic camera With 48 Mega Pixels Low light pictures are better than any other Realme or redmi type Chinese mobile Even its good than OPPO2 PROCESSOR Too good Better than any other Mobile under Rs 100003 Screen  Dont read review of other people You will never realize its Oled or else Screen is good4 RAM You will get pure 4GB free RAM with 4GB model In Realme or Redme you will find  half RAM already full5 Battery Battery is too good I used it full day after full charged No need to connect to charger in the evening Charged it next day when you feel free Even it can play YouTube for half hour with only 2  battery6 FM  Fm recording available with good qualityCONS1 If you play high grafic game for more than 1 hour than it will lag for 10 to 15 second2 No screen recording But you can download any application from Playstore or Samsung store3 Not having magnetic sensor Thats why not good for traveller It will not show you north direction You will face difficulty to know the accurate direction of your targetConclusion  Dont go for any other Mobile brand upto 11k Go for this SAMSUNG mobile  M12 or F12 It is working as per the specifications The phone is getting strucked in the middle of while continuously the application usage is getting struck for a secondI have to close the application once and again I have to open the particular application It is only drawback I faced in this mobile Apart from that the sound quality picture quality and video quality all are good as per the cost provided for the mobile As I purchased this mobile during the Amazon great Indian festival on 7th October I purchased this mobile through online using card as offer applied and I purchased at 8500 change It is affordable for normal mobile price  from Samsung brand If u want to use for normal use it is good mobile If u want to use for high level games and all it is not Okey  So you can go for other mobile model as per your need Bought it under 10k black colour  Average performance overall You will get charger 15wcharging cablewhich is shortjn length and user manual in the boxNo case is provided in the box recommended to buy one with it Body is made of plastic which is of low quality black one looks decent compare to other coloursPros1Battery life is awesome2 day backup for me on moderate usage 2Display quality is great better viewing anglewith good audio support3 There is dedicated micro SD card slot available4 Type c portCons1 Phone is heavy and thick you can feel the weight  when you are using it But will get used it after few hours2 Camera is below Average not a camera centric phone3 OS is laggy you can feel it sometimes when you are using it Samsung One UI is great but it makes it laggy4 Cant do any heavy gaming average game can be possible5 Battery takes time to charge but drains really slow Lasted 2 days in full recharge More than 2 hours to charge fullyOverall this phone is good for media consumption only The features offered by this device at the price range are fabulous There is no lag during the usage The display is good for watching youtube netflix etc The camera is decent wrt the price at which you get it For gaming it is optimized for no lagPerfect optimized performance at this price range Call quality and speakers are good enough Everything is good in this phone camera is okay in daylight means if your facing the source of light your photo will be good but at night the photos are poor and there is no other problem but I was disappointed because the company says true 48MP camera and it has quad camera setup but the photos are not up to mark the photos of my redmi 9 prime which has 13MP QUAD Camera setup are excellent far better than m12 Excellent product ensure you use nonchinese products because of the SAR valuesThe SAR values mentioned by chinese manufacturers are fake they are far higher than what is mentioned It is always better to use from reputed brands because they follow min ethicsIf anyone is facing sluggish UI do thisEnable developer options look for animations disable the animationsYour phone will work like superfast I got it for 8999 with bank discount very good phone for the price Battery is awesomeit lasts for 9 hour continuous video Play and 15 day nirmal use15W charger charges fastFingerprint on side is fast and its easy to unlock then phone on table Other phones have fingerprint at back side which is uselessCamera quality isnt that good but its okayOnly problem is Samsung installs unwanted apps without permission It installed the paisabazaar app without my permission The paisabazaar and policybazaar are the biggest scammers in India Camera quality is awesome no compromise on the qualityBattery life is excellent for my usage of approx 20 nos long call of 5  20 mins average and corporate emails Usage the battery is lasting for almost 3 full days Battery is seriously a MonsterFingerprint reader is an average one No comments  Overall for the price of 10k i got 2k discount from amazon and 1k for using icici card this is an excellent product from Samsung Also to mention the Android v11 is loaded No compromise in security related flaws Excellent phone Go for it PROS 1 VERY BIG BATTERY CASUAL USE CAN GIVE BATTERY BACKUP UPTO 2 AND HALF DAYS 2 BUILT QUALIY IS

Though it comes with quad camera 48 5 5 and 2 MP its not up to the mark camera quality is very poor as compared to other phones which comes under 15K I bought this phone along with the similar priced Xiaomi Note variant and the difference is absolutely noticeableThe fingerprint does not work at allThe wifi calling feature of the phone is worse than the actual mobile network which is pathetic in itselfWhatsApp will not work all throughout the dayI suggest yall go with the usual competitors and ignore Samsung in the cheaper range altogether A decent phone but not meant for heavy taskingScreen

DISPLAY3 BEST CAMERA WITH 48MP4 FAST CHARGER INTHE BOX22W FAST CHARGER5 AND WITH 6GB RAM 😱 64GB I had bought this phone for my fatherinlaw He is pretty satisfied with the performance Battery life is amazing for him he does not use phone much apart from occasional calling and receiving calls and checking whatsapp twice daily and he is getting 335 days of batterylife after one full chargeWe know that we can get better phones from other brands in this range but for elderly the ease of use of Samsung OneUI is really a tipping factor for deciding on this phone This model has similar features as other Samsung mobiles The camera quality is not that great but I dont mind I dont click much pictures anyway its not the best camera but its not that bad In this price range I think this is the best deal Ive got 6GB RAM 128 internal memory expandable up to 1TB with 6000mAH battery and I must say battery life is amazingSince I trust the brand I always go for Samsung Unnecessary apps automatically download on their own We cant control them Any number of times you uninstall them again they will download and install without our role There are no settings in phone to control them Very nuisanceScreenshot is not working  Overall working and performance is not up to mark even for this price level Some other model from Samsung or other brands or honor are best alternatives Samsung refused to replace screen citing physical damage As the entire phone is already covered under warranty for any factory defects there was no need to mention 6 month free screen replacement separately Had I known this I would have taken an Insurance This is clearly a very bad customer experience from a well known brand like samsung In my eyes it has already tranished the high brand image for samsung I had I feel deeply cheated I dont have any games on my phone and no sm app apart from twitter My phone usage about 98  comprises of reading my mails and attachments ie pdf doc xls files etc and voice calls Overall my phone usage is less since I work from home mostly from my laptops But the battery drain is visible within just 3 months of use The use of mobile internet is also low and I usually work with wifi but the power drain is significant while using internet I have checked if any app is draining battery but didnt find anything All this claim of 6000 mah is disappointing I will probably take my phone to the service centre soon Amazing blue colourIf you need battery backup phone and have extream use of phone stock market trader like me go for it without second thought Superb battery 100 would last 15 or 2 daysProcessor is not good enough to handle game So its not gaming phoneScreen refresh rate is quite goodI returned my third class POCO F1 in 8k by cashify and bought this one I got good dealCamera quality is not good enough you need to on 48mp always The phone is excellent The call quality is good too Everything is satisfactory or much better than expectedThe major glitch however is nonoperational USB tethering It simply doesn’t workSo if you want a phone that needs to be taken to the service station the minute you switch it on if you cannot live with a faulty phone or if you must have USB tethering keep away from this Samsung Maine ye cell 17 ko order diya aur 19 ko mujhe recive hua 3days use karne ke baad mera reviewPhone ka Camera aur battery super hai screen size bhi pocket friendly hai battery backups almost 2daysMujhe isme kuch basic kamiyan lagi jo is prise range me nahi hona chahiye jaise aap net ka speed screen me nahi dekh sakte kyunki setting me option hi nahi hai isme net bhi slow chal raha hai Speed show nahi hone se pata hi nahi chalta ki problem cell me hai ya sim network me Mere likhane cell me idea 4g ka speed achha tha leki Isme nahi hai Overall mujhe bahut jyada khushi nahi hui is cell se jabki maine Samsung ka naam dekh kar m12 purchase kiya Please Samsung dhyan de Samsung M12 is not worth its price due to various shortcomings faced by me 1 FINGER PRINT SCANNER DOESNT WORK PROPERLY Position of FP scanner on right side unlike backside of phone in Samsung A21s  other models fails FP Scanning And if mobile has a backcover if the one recommended by Amazon at order stage then FP scanner will fail you 2 FACE RECOGNITION ALSO DOESNT WORK Most of the time Samsung M12 doesnt recognize my face Looks it doesnt like my face with which no problem on Samsung A21s 3 CONTACT PHOTO IN RECENT CALLS FEATURE REMOVED Recent calls appear without Contact Photo With Recent Call feature in other models it was easier to search  Call numbers from Recent Calls List 4 STORAGE 494 GB of Internal Storage  713 GB of SD Card being shown as Used by OTHER details of which no where No way available to scan this storage usage  remove unnecessary OTHER consuming Internal  SD Card Storage 5 NOTIFICATIONS NOT APPEARING ON LOCK SCREEN Despite trying my best Notifications from various apps do not appear on Lock Screen All settings including of Lock Screen tried without any success Think before finalizing Samsung M12 First Samsungs reliability and second I ordered this product by combining them with so much emotion that even if I dont want to understand then I will return it because I will definitely be heard here and when I ordered it I understood that I have got a very good product and I am very satisfied with it I gifted it to my brother he used it regularly there is no problem of any kind you guys must also take it M12 is fulfilled my expectations completely hats off to Samsung Quality camera and fingerprint reader are best of this range Especially big battery gives good support for online classes without interruption totally we are well satisfied with product Good buy within the price  range this thing is powerfull the ones looking for performance this is the product 6 gb ram with 128gb to access with is worthy The system has variety  of settings to choose from this might get slow when google drive is being used for contacts and other things as it directly fetches data from drive but there are other settings you can play with and enjoy games at a very good speed And the charger is powerfulRecommendation for games try games from ppsspp emulator I am writing this review after 3 days of usage I have upgraded to this phone from a Redmi 5A Looks and feel are simply amazing The usage experience is also superb The battery life seems to be v v long when compared to my last phone Overall I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase Seems like a real upgrade from my old Redmi 5A and to top it all Amazon gave me an exchange offer worth Rs 2500 on my 3 year old Redmi 5A I have nothing to complainLast but not the least the delivery experience was also superb delivered within 2 days  And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to himOverall a 5 star experience However I would have loved to give a 6star for battery life as well as the delivery experience Writing this after 4 months if heavy usagePros1 Very very big battery life This battery is so big that you can easily use it for 2days with moderate use2 Very beautiful screen even though it is LCD Samsung has not used any cheap screen You can enjoy your Movies and WebSeries3 Very good camera ultra wide mode is just so beautiful you dont need panaroma mode in this Selfie camera is just awesome 4 You even get headphone jack5 The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching6 I have played games like BGMI CODM NFS with easeMy final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes play games or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher You can download almost 70 movies with ease I am a student  first time I thought  to purchased a smartphone  frommy first salary  I waited for Diwali to get offer price  I searched  all over the internet  to get a budget smartphone  but I dont want to compromise  with RAM ROM Battery Mah and must Made in IndiaAt last I got to know about this smartphonewhich gives 6 gb Ram 128 gb internal storage  and 6000mahI satisfied 100 percent  I never expected  to get this at just 10000 only from Samsung  Samsung m12 gives smooth performance Its 48 mp camera is good but the quality of image it captures is low qualityIt has a long battery of 6000 mah While charging phones heats up But within a few minutesit cools downOverall it is a good phone in 11000Update 6 may 2021Now its one and half month is over and it has started to heat up  unecessary during charging🙄Update  4th July 2021The phone is not taking charging instead it is draining the battery I does not expected this type of issue with samsung This is really irritating that I ordered this phone as brand new and within few months now the power button is not working When I took out to the service center they r saying it is open piece and blaminge that I have opened it They need money to replace the cap inside the button Never expected this from Amazon to give me a used piece or Samsung service center is playing a game for money What would you expect witha battery of the size 5000 that it should be great Well it okay not that greatI think due to the size of the battery the phone feels quite heavyCamera let me say this bluntly that the camera is not great it okiesh time Didnt expect this from the Samsung companyI know the prize is less but didnt expect the camera to be that badIf you are going to buy it for battery performance then you may go for it My review after receiving mobileDont think that samsung phones are hang every time the thing is how you dealing with the phone is matters with any brandRear selfi Camera  awesome performance daylight conditon 455Battery  45Display 45And unexpected features comes within it in this price range bcz it comes with android 11 latest version90hz refresh rate👍working goodSide fingureprint sensor  fastIt support dual volte networkAwesome productThank you samsung for this monster reloaded smart phoneDont worry guys go for it A great device on the heavy side for general usageOrdered for mom who uses WhatsApp Facebook YouTube Battery lasts for at least 2 days easilyThe camera quality is good enough for this price range and good to see the latest Android 11 onboard 4 years of updates makes it worth the investment for long term usage Average phone considering price range1 Camera quality average no slow motion or time lapse feature available no zoom when using 48mp Front camera below average Sometimes I take a photo that doesnt get stored quite annoying2 Weight quite heavy you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand3 screen type lcd not led or amoled4 Batter life looks good with normal usage5 Phone body back panel looks like of plastic it would have been better if matelic had been used6 user interface sometimes very hard to do something like taking a screenshot Could have been given some better option to do that Also I use night model where it gets better into grayscale in night I cant customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it Not an easy option providedFace recognition not fast and accurate I was looking for solid battery backup phone and I found one M12 is awesome in battery backup  display is great Finger print sensor is flawlessOverall a good second phone for my needsThis is going to be a greatSamsung budget phoneI had one incident too  I slipped the phone in a bucket full of water  I took it out immediately and its working fine Overall 3star very bulky and a slightly heavier phone Could work on the bulk and weight of the phone After a few updates the phone slows down Samsung needs to work on the performance of the phone I have been using the phone for 2 months now 6gb ram 128gm rom and I feel that the performance has slowed in just 2 months At times there is lag and the phone screen stops responding completely The pages get stuck and the screen touch also gets weirdProblem areas to sum up1 heavy 2 bulky 3 touch screen is not that great4 slowness of the phoneGood things1 battery life as of now 2 camera 3 finger print reader 4 ok phone for basic usage The overall look of the phone is goodThe features available at this pricing is excellentThe camera quailty is a bit disappointing specially the front cameraThere are very few button option and many are missing which is available in the button menuLot of features are also missing in cameraBattery life is very very good listening to music watching movies and day long games Overall a good phone at the given price rangeHappy to be a SAMSUNG mobile Fan I purchased it for the 6GB128GB combination Though knowing that the processor capacity could be less But it is indeed a surprise 6 GB RAM effect is clearly visible apps launch too fast scrolling too smoothHave been using it only for 3 days  but initial feedback is quite goodI should also mention Delivery  superb I ordered at night 11pm next day 11am the phone was with me Truly Kudos to Amazon team  suppliers delivery and all combined it is lightning fast and really nice Greetings This mobile is a PREMIUM variant in budgetBasic smart phoneThe main attraction is the exynos Processor Samsung flag ship Brand which offers Pristine call Quality and Great ReceptionWho can buy itA person who is looking for a reliable Long runBasic smartphone for whats app Video calls and Working in remote areas where they get weak signalsRecommend for Working professionals SrCitizens and KidsOnline classesNot Recommend for Gamers and who spend most of the day with mobile apps Iam not a gaming userso first of all this review is only for normal users1Very importantly  the battery stands so strong from its competitors2Display though lcd HD is so good from all viewing angles3 I just love the side mounted fingerprint and power button but may be difficult  for some new smartphone users4camera though  not great at this price point it stands stronger than  its competitors with all four cameras5colour variants of phone can be even more optional for users as of now only three courses two usual colors and one slightly different colors6speaker is usual loud but not so great since its competitors atleast gives surround speakers at this price point But clarity of sound is greatbut bass lovers wouldnt  love these speakers7Actually the expectation  and reality  of Samsung  exynos processor  changed my opinion  on their processorit was great 👍u will definitely  love it8 One UI stands apart from all its competitorsespecially mi ui ads on mi phonesIt was my own experience and review with the phoneIf iam wrong at any points peoples can comment me with correct ones so that users buy a better smartphoneTq Battery backup very good Some features are very helpful that is tap to wake up  screen off eye comfort shield dark mode Dolby atmos Transfer massages contacts settings notes app data are very easy from my old Samsung phone Overall experience very good Good quality Samsung phone for general use 6gb ram128gb Android 11 out of the box which is important for security and software complianceupdates for a londer time Good camera Excellent battery life 25 3 days with non gaming sparse content viewing Better than cheap chinese wannabes in quality and comes with Samsung reliability amd latest Android 11 even though it may be nominally behind in a specification or two Product is not working properly got replaced but the issue is still presist and will not be rwolved in near futureI do not that how may buyer are receiving this issue bit I am getting that issueIn phonepe when I enter upi pin that keyboard number are cutting in half sizeThat is the issue and heating so onSound tones are changing automaticallyLoud speaker is not working on call No voice come out in laud speaker on call Got it in Big billion days offer ₹8500 In this price category the phone is goodScreen and battery are GoodCamera quality is below averageLots of unwanted applications preinstalled But you can uninstall some of itThere is no back cover and screen guard in the boxPhone feels little heavierIts ok for minimal usage Not for heavy mobile users Everything about this phone is good but there are some problems also like processor is bit slow so you will see a very small lag bw input and output Too much heavy and width is also too much and it definitely dont looks like 2021 model phone bcz of weight and width of phn specially when technology has so advanced that there are too slim and light weight phns available in the market it took like phn is from 2015 something Screens performance is definitely not upto the markIm a student and I  generally use laptop for much of my work and uses mobile very little so cant give that much detailed review about everything but yeah I can say one thing that  if you are a student than it will definitely serve the purpose for which you will buy it My earlier m31s stopped working suddenly and in order to have a backup during lockdown purchased this one It is budget friendly if bought in sale Same as other phones in size which are being launched lately speed and memory in sync However camera and finger print scanner a big turn off Dont go for it if camera  pics are main purpose or you use that often Got it for 95kIt deserves 9k as other brands are selling same phones at such priceBattery backup is the primary reason for buying this48 MP camera does not give good quality pics Its just that they have faked by increasing the MP of camera without actually improving image quality4 camera is useless Anybody would use only one camera So its better to give just one camera with good quality rather than to give 4 average cameras Its the worst phone I have ever seen The build quality is really poor And speakers of the would will give you a night mare We cant hear the phone even if its in your pockets  Speakers are toooo low I would definitely not recommen this phone Instead opt for mi or anyother brand where you would get tons of features at this price I feel regret buying this phone After using this mobile for 2 months I would say its an ordinary mobile for adults who are average usersAs i said its an average mobile good call clarity and user interfaceOverall mobile is quite slow you wont feel like its 4G RAM even the contact search will take few secondsCamera is below average 48 mega pixel is not upto the mark I have used 48 mega pixek redmi note 7 pro video clarity is very bad selfie camera is the worstMacro lens is not clearIrrespective of the apps you use it will be slow I dont play games but for sure its not suitable for playing heavy gamesBattery is good will come for more than 25 days with normal usage Best for eldersDisplay is okaySide mounted finger print sensor is coolPrice is quite high with the above drawbacks The phone has good battery better than most other phonesThe performance is not upto the mark Camera doesn’t look like 48 pixelWriting 48 pixel camera 6GB RAM and not experiencing such level of performance based on specs raises doubts on SamsungDefinitely compare with other phones in the before marking a purchase decision Purchased Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone to replace an under preforming mobile Have been using this phone for the last one monthIt is lovely in appearance Has decent storage capacity quick data retrieval capability good Battery life Camera performance is commendableI recommend Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone for those who are looking for a good mobile phone with decent performance First time i am faced the problem online purchase after 10 Days mobile display nit working the acko insurance party not collecting he told go to service center and  repair it we can reimbursing the invoice amount but when i am going to add bank details these is A difficulty in IFSC Code Till today my mobile not ready and not possible to online Update  Phone becomes hot on using for 10 minutes Poor battery performance in around 810 minutes 1 of battery is consumed while browsing some app no music or videos were played Phone is thick and heavy to hold and it brings pain in fingers and hand this cannot be blamed as weight is already mentioned in case description Never expected such product from Samsung Having trouble with network connection for mobile data access  hotspot alsoUser interface also not userfriendly Heavy to handle for prolonged usegeCall recorder toggle switch also not found during call screen buttonsNot even gestures available for emergency torch light on  off Only available in notification switch panelConnection issue faced while browsing YouTube thumbnail not showing Facebook buffering to play video  scrolling got struck repeatedly and even browser app update also could not complete even after several attempts in playstoreBattery backup performance was also not satisfied even when 6000MAH capacity configuration with 6GB RAM  128GB STORAGE availableVery embarrassing experience with this new Samsung Galaxy M12 after 3 years smooth usage with my present deviceredmi y2 Mobile have a decent lookFor this money range we should not expect highIt will flexible to our parents for youth you should think twiceBattery life was good Fingerprint was perfectFace unlock when light was sufficient it works goodIn low light bit late but worksMain drawback was weight of mobile it was bit heavyFront Camera have decent image in daylight but we will observe Noise in ImageSomething with back CameraThis review is purely my experience with M12 mobile After usage of 6 months Im satisfied with the smartphone In this budget this is possibly one of the best offerings In the world of Androidnowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price rangeCamera is OK enough At least OK for a 10k phoneSound quality is loud and clear with display of good quality Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyableInterface is clean and multitasking is smooth Charging is fast enough Obviously the best part is its massive battery and power usage With moderate use it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the goIn the 1011k category this is possibly the best Ive used so far This is a phone for ages to keepThanks to Amazon delivery was in perfect conditionPS Before buying even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews Im a common user and my understanding is if youre expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone then your expectations are to be blamed Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored onesIf you want top of the line you gotta spend top of the lineThis phone gets the BASICS right and that is what matters in the long run And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera even if they dothey will compromise in some other areas Whereas M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner Overall if you want Smooth operations with Reliability trust Samsung M12 Battery life is so good  and camera quality  is average  like 13 mp Front camera is like 2 mp Fingerprint reader working without touch finger When we hold in hand then finger  print reader trust to read any part of hand so it was problem Processing system is very low And in this mobile internet speed very slow And in low network  its  internet  not worked Only show processing Its budget phn with all facilities plus Samsung brand Its a good choice You can buy it without doubt if you want a good battery life  good picture quality  good camera also its not lagging in game good processor and ram with no overheating issue In this budget its the best budget and pocket friendly phone You cant expect more in this budget i bought this phone from amazon with in 6 months of my purchase  one day it just got heated up in my hand and went blank i went to samsung auth repairs and i was told that its mother board has corrupted and needs to get changed but it is not covered in warranty then what the warrenty is for they asked 9000 to repair it so i have no choice but leave it that way lost 110000 rs will never buy samsung product ever The phone works rather smoothly has a decent battery life where it lasts the entire day with the charge being at 47 by midnight The camera performs well for the price except the camera quality in the dark is grainy and could be better There is a weight to it which adds to the build of the phone There is one speaker grill on the right side of the phone and has excellent audio Would recommend 1010 Except a single band Wifi rest all is fine I see the product description doesnt say much about its wifi band support It should have said that it supports only 24ghz bandI have no complaints about the others stuffs except that samsung should not bloat the software bundle with so many non essential packages that I cant uninstall Dear all I am writing this review very honestly may other user get benefitted from thisI used this for 3 weeks and I would say it is clearly waste of your hard earn money Pro  Only batteryCons 1Heavy  and bulky2 Not adjustable in single hand for selfie4 Camera front Worst quality all time grainy pic no beautification5 Back camera also produce worst quality6 Processor is not much for heavy user7 Many time screen lag and hangDear it would be batter you purchase resume dalne or opportunity in this price segmentIf you use zoom app then go for snapdragon process over 700 it will be you option of virtual background in mobile  Media tek processor will not do muchI wnna to back this phone but window close by amazon and I purchased its glass and guard and covers So no option left Pl dont buy this phone Samsung create waste product in camera  In This phone I am big samsung fan but nowadays samsung making the phones which are not capable for compete with other phones in this price range and mid range WIFI 5 is not here  they can give only amoled screen  nowadays amoled is normal Camera is not good but its ok for this price range Only battery life is good Giving preloaded apps which are uninstallable Buy in your own choice if you can add 115k more then go for other company phones coz nowadays these samsung phones getting hang problem  6 months later I had m20 which had the same problem Fingerprint reader is really good and quickBattery life is good tooCamera quality is decent since I m not much into photography I am goodProcessor isnt powerful enough to run heavy games  but it dont play heavy games so this mobile is perfect for meAbsence of secure folder is kinda heartbreaking but nothing that we cant manage Had a mix up Galaxy M21 with M12  Both comes next to next when you search for M21  The price of the 6 GB varient of m12 and 4 GB of m21 is also the same  Only problem is M21 is Super amoled  Full HD with latest processor   No comparison with both  Realized this only on unboxing when the screen looked very ordinary on running the phone The lag to move from one function to the next is glaring  even when it is brand new  Reported this to amazon  They could not help as the seller support page is just a computer generated one which just runs you in circles  Basically no way to contact seller Only a postal address  in todays world how is it even going to work  Tried seller website No reply  I was more than willing to Pay more since it was partly my mistake  Feel cheated with price of a decent phone which starts off slower than my 4 yr old current phone  If only the seller could help  Samsung Galaxy M12 can be a good choice for customers who are looking for a Samsung smartphone under Rs 15000 The smartphone offers a quadrear camera HD display and is backed by a 6000mAh battery which can easily last for two days Camera quality is real good  Fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive sound quality is betterHowever the phone is on the heavier side Does not comes with the clear case and headphones and you might want to add a good screen guard and case Thank you Been using this device as a secondary phone for my office purpose Camera is not good comes with bloatware every time there is an security update the bloatware apps are reinstalled again have to delete them again and againPerformance is disappointing the phone is slowDisplay is Ok but there is a noticeable light leak from below panel visible on screenDevice is very heavy thick and long in length making it hard to use with single handI am using it as secondary device I only use for office apps like MS Teams Outlook with office admin portal app which gives my company complete root access to device so I am using it only for office communication purpose and I am glad it’s not my primary deviceSave your money go for other device not this one I would not even recommend this to gift to elderly as this is heavy thick and slow phone Fingerprint sensor often doesnt respond Without any reason phone goes in deep sleep mode and go for 35 cycle of restarting automatically then start working Updates are available but not getting installed properlyCalled service centers several times but no response received It appears a faulty productCamera appears good but if you compare the quality of pic with other models of Samsung its quality is very average 👂Do not waist your money on this mobile👍Mobile is good as secondary usage non slippery surface is the only good thing👍You can change video quality in apps like utube Amazon prime etc👎Worst display👎Camera display and touch quality not good👎Heavy weight 220gmNote✍️Go for another mobile with latest configuration Used for about a monthBattery and fast charge is good to have Battery really lasts But phone is very heavy due to that Lenth of phone is long too so has a chance to fall if the pocket isnt deep enoughTakes a good 230 hours to chargeKey pad is sensitive and greatTouch lockfingerprint senser isnt upto the mark I have used honor 7x and their sensor is far betterScreen size is impressiveCamera is good This phone does it job but dont fall for 90HzIts gimmick higher refreshing screen are only good if phone works smooth This Amazon app dont even work properly while scrolling these apps stutterAnd junk It automatically downloads unnecessary apps and makes phone even slowerPlease go by other smart phone in this rangeAnd if you are reading this review in 2021 please never consider phones below 20k for this brand Go but mi moto realme OPPO vivo you will get what you want This mobile has got excellent battery backup its a beastThe display is also best 👍The camera is okok quality ie Average quality as if u zoom a little the pixel decreasesThe face regonization is very bad it doesnt work at all you have to move ur face to 12 cm distance

heavy phoneFor business purpose I recommend this phoneOverall 810 The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Dear Amazon Customer serviceAm Shailendra an Prime member of AmazonI purchased an Samsung Mobile phone M12 from Amazon portalbut received an faulty phonewhere unable to hear voice in callsrequested Amazon to replacethey called me and undergoes an test of Mobilefinds the fault and ordered replacement on 9th of this monthTill none of technician delivery pickup agent cane to me to replaceAm herewith attaching screenshot for your referenceRequesting Amazon Technical customer service team to sort out my issue at earliest The honest review could have been 25 considering performance  camera quality yet Im giving it 5 because  when i was about to buy this phone i was on a budget and this was the best option for me a 6128 model of a top brand at 13500RS was a good deal and my top priority always was battery back and this amused me with its battery back up If you are looking for a phone with strong battery back up with limited budget Go for it Otherwise youll disappointed For my use case a single charge lasts me around 6 days charge 100 to 40 after which I recharge again Actually it should last me more than 10 days I think if I allow it to drop to 1 before recharging My use case is office related video calls email WhatsApp online shopping connecting to chrome cast and watching YouTube videos on tv sms phone calls reading kindle books etc Screen ON time about an hour or so a day depending on video call duration I do not play games on my phone I keep it on battery saving mode and 60hz screen refreshBeen using the phone for more than a month now Very satisfied with the performance Only slight issue was the slightly heavier weight of the phone compared to my previous phone But I have gotten used to it and it does not bother me at all nowRegarding the screen being non fullHD I thought it would be something I would notice Nope I feel no difference when reading books on kindle Maybe teenagers with better eyesight will notice but I definitely cannotIn summary I’m very happy with the purchase I just hope Samsung keeps pushing the updates till at least android 13 and security updates for at least 4 years That would be perfect The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Phone is good at this price Battery life is long It will lasts upto 2 days if you are doing simple tasks on itProcessor is goodBut one thing here is to mention that if you are looking for good camera quality phone this is not it Its front camera is not good Picture quality ruining when you zoom in So Overall good phone 🖖 except camera 📷 First of the phone was a worth purchaseand best budget promise by samsungFor a normal user epecially for middle aged ones and new android experiencing ones it is a better choise why because of the branded non chinese mobilePerfomance 1Camera quality  primary camera is best and give awesome clicks but not impressed in secondary but i repeat its a budget based handset by samsung2Finger print reader take a few seconds some times but in a wide range it is fast3Battery life  its awesome no word to sayAnd fast charging 15wA negative portion is weight its weight is about 221 gm its heavier i noted this here because samsung introduced m21 model with more specifications and perfomance carrying the same monster typical battery 6000 mah but weighing only around188gm is very lite weight and easy to handle remember the prize differenceOverall my conclusion is the product is worth for money I am completely satisfied why because i had that much moneySo no over expectations thank you samsungAnd especially thankyou Amazon for best service again I bought this phone to last 5yearsthus OPPO or Vivo was not an optionmy first phone was Samsung metronow its Samsung galaxy m12user interface is goodthe phone barely looses any charge when idle or used via wired earphonessatisfied till now Giving 3 stars because1  It only have got 24 ghz wifi card 5 ghz wifi will not work on this So if you have modern day fiber internet wifi chances are it wont probably be compatible with this device2  It says 48MP camara but it is not the best camara regarding the specs I dont understand why it got 4 camaras when other 3 are barley average in terms of qualityIf you can have few extra thousands then go with m30s seriesI understand Samsung has to do stuff to do cost cutting and marketing I also own a m31 that one is better Also random apps will download from samsung app store until you dont force stop samsung app store Good battery back upSound and picture could have been better at this priceUnable to make credit card payments through this phone states version should be above 183My prior phone was doing it bought 4 years agoWithin weeks timePhone at this cost hasLow camera qualityHanging issues unfortunateTechnician checked and advised for replacement Agreed with issuesDont see options to return please stay away folks I have faced at least 2 bugs while using this phone in whatsapp1 after capturing image send button was not available on the screen2 I was not able to send messages to anyone while my other apps were working fine which uses internet connectionsamsung and whatsapp developer please look into thiscamera quality is average or near to poor Beyond expectations an affordable phone in this budget with great features loaded This phone has the latest android 11 with a great camera very good battery life Exynos processor IPS display with 90Hz and is well built This phone is easy to use for gaming and has a lot of memory to store all your media files and documents Timely delivered and thanks to Amazon for such fast delivery heavyweight mobile camera not good only brand name none other than  other brand like infinix Asus are too good to use  good looking but not so special dont go for famous brands please use and welcome new brands and functions if you are really know how to use mobiles then use under 15 k rupees dont waste a lot of money on costly mobiles I just bought a brickThe phone is too heavy as brickSlow as snailCamera quality is worstInterface seems oldPrice  avgAmazon return policy wont allow you to return that is biggest disadvantageI insist potential buyers to avoid going for such tempting offers on this device n go for MI Realme for way better features n feel in this price segment What benefit we will get if I have 6gb or 8gb ram How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature Very much disappointed with this big drawback Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12 Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description Seems like Im using 10 years back mobile Its super heavy Resolution is no good and I have eye pain Camera is very bad Yes they have given 6000 mah battery but it takes more than 2 hours to charge fully And battery does not work like a 6k mah batteryDoes not expect this from Samsung as they have huge market nowadays compare to Apple worldwide The phone is great Good display and UI Comes with 6000 maH huge battery Charging is quick but 1 thing that comes as negative is the camera The camera doesnt seem like 48 MP It struggles in low light  the Front camera also suffers the same problem You can certainly go for it if you are OK with below standard camera Amazon delivery was excellent The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It is best at this cost from a brand like samsung Display resolution is HD but its 90 Hz Battery life is awesome lasts 2 days Camera is disappointing though There isnt any gcam available yet No silicon case in box One UI is the best UI I have ever used yet Fast updates 15 Watt charger included takes almost 2 hrs for full charge which lasts for almost 2 days As far as my opinion is concerned the over all features are Ok The drawback features are1 M12 is out of Super Amolrd Screen2 Back Fingerprint is more covenient than side3 Camera quality is not so hifi than other models4 S Bike mode should given which will be helpful ehile driving5 Charger model is different  than other M series Mobiles with battery of 6000 mah Purchased in JuneWhat I likeBattery power I charge it only once in 2 days Being a mediumto heavy user  its a big thumbs up Storage capacity Navigation speed Not made in ChinaWhat I dislike Its quite heavy Eyes hurt within 3 hours It never happened with any of the phones I have  used so far more than 10 phones   Some of them were really cheap too I  dont know why this phone makes the eyes hurt I am not a particular fan of  Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me Camera here truly is just an accessory Well anyway I didnt buy this phone  for cameras my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are  even lower than what I expected Screen resolutionIf you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor  never used one before but it seems alright so far I baught this phone but after 23days use i fill like its Display having some flickering issue then I Raised a Complaint Then a Technician visited my phone and told me everything is fine Them after 45 days later I again Feel Like Choppy And lagging problm and The Flickering issue Then I called customer service they told me its out of replacement Policy But when I insisted them they agreed to replace It Now I am satisfied With the phonePhone is smooth  Just go in developer options and Set the animation scale to 05x Them Everything will be smoothBattery is Monstar 6000MAHDisplay have TFT

bloatwares are present and makes continued attemps to trick you for installationCamera is fairly average should have been little improvedNo fast charging supportOverall good budget buy if you are looking for non Chinese budget smartphone I expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment but after buying it I totally regret myself But as a reviewer I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobilePros1 Long Battery Life2 Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem like do not disturb while in driving etc3 Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scannerCons1 Total Weight of Mobile2 Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam3 Display quality is also not good4 Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile5 Last but not least the worst thing is the processor A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processorIf anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range just go with either Redmi or Realme Those brands will really satisfy you a lot I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features thats why I recommended this brand 👍 I liked the phone battery last long even I tool 6GB ram version but the phone is little sluggish in performance may be the chipset is not great in performing daily task But one UI is great even 120 he refresh rate I found phone performance not upto my expectations while comparing to my old redmi phone but I liked that unnecessary apps are not getting installed like redmi Camera is great and battery life is awesome Review it after using for a monthIts battery backup is quite impressive camera is good but could be more simpler interface I am not a gaming person but as per my Experience its working smooth but yes sometimes for a sec you will it might be slow but overall its a worth Price product as of now It was very happy when I received it that I havent spent money on China mobile but within 10 day I started regretting as it has started to hang very frequently and thats annoying I havent added extra memory card and using phone with only one SIM Return policy was 7 days and it started hanging from 9th day  Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature GREAT battery life camera UI lives up to its reputationGreat specs all round only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi “5G wifi”When you buy a phone with such great specs it’s a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is 🤮🤮 For this price  Nothing great to be expectedIts a low end phone So everything about this phone is below average  except batteryBad ambient light sensor decent camera decent amount output

or koi help nahi ki ja rahi haiअमेजॉन से प्रोडक्ट मंगाया था यह अभी तक 20 का कोई सर्विस नहीं हुआ है कोई नहीं पिकअप भी नहीं आर्डर पेंडिंग में और जो अमाउंट थी वह भी कट गया है 20 दिन हो चुके हैं पूरे I am writing this review after using the device for 10 daysIt is very good mobile in this price range The battery life is awesome lasts for 3 days once full charged with normal usage The speed is also good works well for daily usage The camera is not the best does not feel like 48 MP The 65 display is very impressive Gives amazing video and audio qualityOverall I liked this one and highly recommend to buy it I have been using Samsung M21 also my 2 family members using same modelSo thought to buy this M12 for my father1 Biggest disappointment DisplayLooks like a old age mobile2 Camera is ok ok3 Only good thing is battery 🔋4 Cheap plastic body5 Heavyweight6 Go for Samsung M21 its more better Camera quality is very poor and display quality too This model is not listed in the exchange models list also How funny that Amazon sold a mobile and they arent considering the same model for exchange what kind of business ethics is this where as the same model is listed on Flipakrt for exchange models  My contact book is not too large around 700 contacts yet it takes a couple of seconds to load it It didnt happen in my previous mobiles even though they were less powerful than this device Although it has 4 cameras at the back the portrait mode is completely nonsense My previous phone had only 2 cameras on back yet its portrait mode was a thousand times better Fingerprint sensor is on the power button and a real pain to use when you have a mobile cover I am writing this review after the usage of 25 days It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues  charging speed is very much disappointed  taking lot of time to charge up The main issue I am facing is that the phone battery  is slow charging and quick battery draining Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast 😡😡 Decent phone at 9000 after bank offers The processor and display are not upto the standard But given that this phone has knox security I have little to complain about This phone is strictly for old people who just needs a secure phone for day to day usage like messaging calling etc Not recommended for any user who wants to do a lot of multitasking or gaming I buy this phone on Diwali offer for Rs9500 on 30 Oct 2021For this price the phone is worthy enoughNow it been nearly 20days of usagePros1Best Battery life even in heavy usage it hold for a day its amazing2Rear Camera Shows the real face and color tone without additional filters in that way I love it3Display more than enough90Hz Awesome4Fastest FingerPrint Reader in this segmentCons1Front Camera not too bad as well as not good tooaverage for selfie loversbut for me I like this oneNote it Mainly👇👇2Processor or something make the phone laglag in popup the keyboard itself is not goodif it is a bug need fix immediately3Asking Updates for all the apps may be it because of the phone launch day it was March 2021Im a Samsung fan So for me it is a better option for this rateif you love Samsung buy it without the second thoughtApart all of the above the best phone for daily moderate usersOK for heavy usageFor Hours I bought this for my mother I ll just list what I dont like1 Too heavy Dont buy this for old people2 Camera is shaky and output is not great I dont know why they have given four cameras3 Too much of useless Samsung apps and galaxy items interrupting in between I cannot able to disable these Samsung is cheating people with marketing big numbers for a product All the specifications are just on paperIn reality every specification is just subparCamera quality is same as what you see in phones that released in 20122013 like Galaxy Grand 2Battery is advertised as 6000mAh but in actual it gives the same result as a 3000mAh batteryProcessor is just utter crapSeeing a phone for the first where the initial setup itself lags like anythingDisplay quality feels same as resistive touch era phonesScreen shows bleeding symptomsI wish they had a return policy instead of replacement This hand phone is perfect for those who want it for day to day use with decent gaming experience also security wise it is good one actually before purchasing this phone i had watched so many videos in YouTube and amzon After using it for some days I think it is very good for an average person but if you want to compare this phone with some other devices i think that you should avoid to buy this mobile phone also if you have been using some high end devices for some times then also you should think before purchasing this phone In my personal opinion i think this is very good phone with excellent camera and battery life also performance wise it is good for day to day use Itne kam daam mai Samsung ka bharosa aur NonChinese device wo bhi made in India So go for it Im sure this phone will not disappoint you Device is HeavyCamera Quality is very poorScreen Quality is very poor compare to othwr device in marketFast charging is OkBattery backup is also OkI would recommend try other device in the same segment Like Redmi Mi Poco I had a lot of doubts before purchase on seeing the negative reviews lying here and there but my experience with the Samsung m12 was really exciting It has good battery backup the display even though 720p is not bad to look at screen brightness is optimum RAM management is good for day to day apps Havent found any lags  Havent tried playing any games on it The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge  Over all it is a great phone The true monster Update After using it for nearly 6 months Im facing proximity sensor issue which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which Im planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube The battery life is still awesome Hey so this is an honest review from my side I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isnt so great The battery life isnt good Once the battery goes below 50 it drains really fast Talking about camera quality it isnt as good as expected The pictures look grainy finger print reader doesnt accepts your finger sometimes and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect ProsGreat Battery Life Upto 2 days minimumGreat CameraSuperior smoothness in usability4GB RAM for multitaskingBuilt and feel of the phoneI use the phone primarily for clicking product photos for my website and business calls On a personal level a powerful battery and camera saves me time and gives me a hassle free experience  I use all sorts of video and image editing apps that requires a lot of ram usage and the phone has never crashed so far Also does well for gaming Hard core gaming may be sluggish But for the price perspective this phone is all you ever needConsFace Detection  for unlocking — takes atleast 3 seconds to react The fingerprint sensor is comparatively faster But both is a little annoying at times Please do not buy this phone because Samsung Galaxy M12 phone generating too much heat with this I can not operate the phone in normal condition I kept the order in return and the authorized technician came and he decided the is phone working normal but the compliant was too much heat generates when its in the handset in this case how I could not take calls and operate the mobile there is no return policy and only replacement but that also not happened I was very much disappointed with amazons service and I lost 13499 and my requirement not fulfilled Very heavy phone Peculiar problem of Samsung phone always in hung state if you want to use in outdoor in day time you cant see anything bon screen  For screen shot you need to put an extra floating menu on screen which is very irritating No compass app you can run on phone as it lacks the sensors Friends dont buy it Chinese phones are far far better than this I also purchased it just to avoid Chinese phone and now I repaint it Since sep 21 I am using it and this is worst phone I have ever had New year and Christmas day special status quotes wishesa

Quality is so ugly while playing game 🎯🎮7 mobile heating while charging  using tym both8 Its taking 34 hours for charging While Samsung boasts about the 48MP camera the picture quality is not up to the mark I was looking for a smartphone for my mother with a price range of 911 k and was confused between Resmi 9 series and Samsung M12 I finally decided to go for samsung since it has a good resale value The battery life is just amazing since my mom uses the phone for basic functions like calls watching videos on youtube and social media the battery lasts easily for 3 days on a full charge ProsOn the internet some found the phone heavy a little bit but for me it looked like a sturdy mobileGreat Rear camera quality Good front camera qualityUltra quick fingerprint sensorDescent battery life indeed suggest you use the phone mildly and charge the battery only up to 8595 for at least 1 week I use the phone mostly for YouTube and social media and with that using its battery last for about 25  3 days or sometimes 35 days as wellConsFace Recognition is slow but you wont need that if you use fingerprintNot meant for highend gaming cause sometimes frame dropsBtw purchased the phone for Rs 9499 Not up to the mark too many cons1phone ram management is not good it hangs too much 90hz screen is only for show whenever u set screen at 90hz its start hamging2 VGA camera is better than this 48megapixal camera3when i start mobile and setup it hang and restart more than 2 time so i will suggest  dongo for this phone I bought this smartphone for my mother as I knew there would be no large applications used so the phone would not need much processing But this phone started to freeze and lag even when applications of size 10 15 MB were installed I have been a loyal Samsung customer for nearly 10 years but now its time to move on I thinkI will not suggest this phone to anyone You can get far better phones at this same cost Fingerprint reader battery life and camera are 👍good as compare to others within this budget My decision was very clear before purchasing that I would buy only phone within ₹13000 so I purchased and in my opinion  if ones budget is same then go ahead dont thing and read negative  review The fingerprint reader is placed at an ideal location and works without fail The battery life is really good even though it takes a long time to charge so in all good camera quality of the primary camera is good for everyday use The design of the phone is such that it does not wobble and there are no protruding camera The built quality feels solid No fingerprint smudgesI have experienced some jitters but nothing to complain about Calling over WiFi facility works very good and the earpiece quality is decent No issues with proximity sensor Though it lacks the bells and whistles of its competitors it does well There is nothing extraordinary to write about but it is actually good as there are nothing extremely negative to write about Buy it and it will work as its supposed to Also trusting on Samsung brand name for data privacy Great budget smartphone from SamsungGot a bit worried after reading all the negative reviews about the phones display and camera but they didnt fail me or Samsung Great battery life and display looks awesome Camera is normal neither extremely extraordinary nor disappointing Overall camera is satisfactory at this price RAM and Processor give very smooth performance Dont get worry about the bullshit negative reviews by people who want gold at the price of brass  Go for it I have gone through many reviews for this phone But Ive not seen anyone talking about sound quality Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine Maybe my particular handset is troublesome Anyways since I got the phone on my hand I couldnt explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark I purchased Samsungs phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers mainly YouTube reviewers claimI am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies manufacturers use these days Still Ive gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 1112 yearsI got this model Galaxy M12 exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse The sound was pretty loud be it media sound ringtones call sound etcFrankly speaking Ive not checked gaming camera and other features the way I did with sound quality Id recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible Good phone for the price The responsiveness of the screen to touch is a little wanting Battery not as good as expected lasts for about a day and a half with moderate usage  Camera is great but its a pain to select and toggle through the settings Really have to look hard to realise it is a high resolution image My other purchase is an M12 which feels really premium compared to this phone The price difference at time of purchase was only 2k Firstly amazon cc is very inefficient in handling my queries series of wrong communication from chat support phone support My email is not yet answered since 8 days Now samsung m12 phone  out of 64gb only 5052gb is available and remaining 1213gb occupied by system Out of 4gb ram 18gb approx is occupied by system Camera quality is very very poor Phone hangs too much like if i unlock the phone it takes more than 1015 sec to display clock navigation icons notifications panel etc Phone heats up if we use gdrive maps hotspot Screen and body is very delicate Plz think much before you go for this An upset frustrated Amazon cusromer Sameer Its a budgeted phone 6 GB 128 GB storage variant is good Battery backup is awesome Took 335 hrs to full charge Not happy with front camera quality  Awful at night NO slow motion capturing feature Rear camera is better in daylight  good at night Not happy with side touch sensor Took so many attempts sometimes to unlock But overall I am happy using it because navigation sensor battery backup  performance of phone is good compared with other brands Great product for the money Thankfully its not Chinese and theres peace of mind when using banking apps or other apps which warrants security of non Chinese servers The camera to screen everything is as good it can get for the money and software is way above what the Chinese offers After use of one month i can sayExcellent battery life sound quality is good Its not easy to handle due to its heavyness but it can be bcos of 6000mah battery Fingerprint sensor is good Camera quality is not good as expected from 48 mega pixels Front camera is not good at all But overall experience till now is very Good Want to give 5star but one star less due to its camera and Handling Samsung camera is supposed to be far better than Lyf Wind regretably it is on par You could sell this lower end of the product range for may be 7000 or max 7500 Beats many local brands yet not satisfactory Giving a 4 starFeed back Sold my old Wind Lyf phone for Rs 1350 to a small dealer Rs 450 exchange value is not fair at all like you I have searched the reviews for this mobilejust keep this two things in your mind while you choose to buy this mobile1 If you are a low range mobile user and u trying to buy high range mobile then this is the perfect mobile with exotic features and to perfect price like 105002 If you are a high range user mobile price of above 15000 then this will be little low campares to that m12 but m12 gives it own best PerformancesYou cant  compare this mobile 10500rps  to the mobiles above 15000 because  if you put plus money then it comes with  more features  thats the differenceso you must compare the features with price tags then scroll to the reviews  for performance of the mobile  like you and me Conclusion  Review is only for this mobile sothis kind a features with this price is absolutely  worth it Performance  was damn good of every features and last Final finger print sensor is a exotic feature in this mobile the it works is like DAMN GIRLThank you I have just picked it up in budget category for day to day needs well Im not disappointed with my choice its a great package to offer at this price point keeping my needs in mindHowever the phone is very sluggish in response if youre looking for performance from this phone kindly stay away it will disappoint youHope my review helps prospective buyers After using since 5 days1 90Hz display really smooth2 Camera quality little better if you select 48M camera setting  Not really good one for photography3battery backup is too good as I am not a gamer4 Too heavy to carry After using with back cover it feels almost 500 GM to me5 Voice clarity is really good6 4G speed is awesome7 Overaally its a nice phone  Bought this phone a week agoBudget Phone for people who need a good smart phone at lower rate with good battery backup of 6000mahPhone is not very heavy screen is bigger which is good for watching moviesvideosNegative keypad is not showing fully when using upi mobile appOtherwise phone is goodWill write more reviews after using it for some more time This product is fantastic for this price I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user it can easily last you and day or a day and a half And for a light user it can last you 2  3 days Also the cameras are decent the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting but the front camera is pretty good I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price The screen is respectable its not pixely but its not the best ofc The screen is pretty smooth its 90hz is really nice and smooth Gaming on this phone is ok I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY highpowered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better 1 Look and feel of the mobile is good but little heavier due to 6000 mAH battery2 Camera quality is good but slow  takes more time to save the picture3 Fingerprint reader is good4 Overall performance is slower5 Battery support  2 days under normal use It got deliver on 14th April After using few days I find my moto phone was better in features I am not able to take screenshot using power button  vol down button It always show Power off  restart  emergencyMotion and guestures features are limited compare to moto No option for 3 finger touch screen shot or palm slide screenshot Rest is ok Not much imprressed I ordered it on 2nd of may and got it on 5th of may I am pretty much with which which the phone comes This phone has really exceeded a lot of expectations regarding the features that its loaded with But the only thing with which  I am disappointed with is its size🤔 its quiet fat😅to say But really I am astonished with its battery backup Its a huge for phones in this price range It comes with 6000mah battery which I felt a monster precisely😳 The cameraOMGits just too good It comes with 84mp quad camera  It has a 10x zoom which is super clear The fingerprint reader is mounted on the sidedown the volume button Its too awesome It  senses the print even on a thin plastic sheet is placed on it Other than all this  to say it a great budget friendly and a must buy on the other hand It should be in ones list  if heshe is looking for the monster in 10k bracket💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 1 To begin with battery life is pretty good however it takes little longer to fully charge the phone2 Front came is pathetic Rear camera is some how ok for basic usage3 Fingerprint will work whenever it wants to not everytime you need it so remember phone pinlock to be on a safer side4 Phone got hanged twice within 15 days of normal usage5 Overall this is a phone for elderly person or for someone who is low to minimal user on a daily basis Bought this new phone for my mom on 5th Oct the day I recieved the phone I had issue with camera quality checked and confirmed by Amazon technician as well also faced issue with dialler tone while making call there was no sound of the dialler tone Amazon replaced and sent me a new phone on the 9th OctThe new phone had no issue with Camera but issue with dialler tone was still there I raised the issue with Amazon and they provided me an appropriate solution with amazing service and initiated the refundI dont think Samsung phones are worth buying at the price range of below 10kI might prefer going for Realme MI Vivo or any other brand over Samsung I bought this phone for my mother as a secondary phoneGamingbwas our of question needed good battery life and goo calling supportPros Battery Life is amazing the phone never heats up No matter whatIts a sub par processor But does the normal job Dont play or install any games on this Use it for calls mediaOne UI is clean But make sure to delete all the junk apps and disable swing seevices90Hz is actually visibleCamera bump is non existentThere is WiFi calling unlime a lot of people suggestConsHeavy and thick phoneStutters when you give it some intense jobNo 5GHz WiFiColours arent the best at this price Display could have been much better But wont notice Unless you compare it side by sideFor 10k its a good buy for a light userIf youre a heavy user Go for Poco M3 or Redmi Note 10 or Micromax In1 if ur budget is 10k I am writing review after using almost 1month of using this phone so please take serious before buying this There is no return policy only replacement available So think twicePlease dont fall in offer worst phone ever always ask for software updateHeavy in weightCamera Quality poorBattery life poorSound Quality poorDont fall in rat race I am reviewing this after 2 months of usage It was good  It is little heavy compared to other samsung mobile The battery life is good But not as worth for 6000mah I dont play games i just use social media For social media useage its bit Oke And the camera Seriously 48mp is not that good its Oke Just oke But its totally budget friendly For its cost I believe the phone is worth it Till now it hasnt shown any problems Everything works fine Battery is magnificent Only problem is the fingerprint sensor It is on the side on top of the power button So the space is very small Most of the back covers or flip covers cover this fingerprint sensor partially and the device does not unlock The ear piece speaker is not working from day one  I had gifted the phone to a senior citizens He was using the phone on speaker mode He did not tell me about it until I found him using speaker to talk By the time I came to know about the issue 7 days had past Now no return option available And I went to samsung authorised service centre there they dont have spares to rectify the problem So still we are using the phone with speaker on Did not expect such a quality from a big brand like samsung Feeling very disappointed All over best phone to buy at this price rangeProsUI is too easy to operate very fast based on android oneBattery 🔋 is too good giving backup upto 10 hrs of heavy dutyCharger is 15w slidely charging fastDisplay is very power efficient  size is goodNo heating issueSecurity review is goodProcessor Speed is likely goodFingerprint sensor is very fast  side mountedConsCamera features are not given like pro mode slowmotion fast motionPhoto quality need to be more advancedDevice is little bit thik causing of the powerful 6000 mah batteryDisplay is not so bright also not so dark  colour are not displaying as expectedExpected amoled display as Samsung always given in the pastSpeaker sounds like good but volume is not so loudWeight is little bit heavy I got the product delivered superfastt in just 3 days I got my Asus Max Pro M1 exchanged  and I must say it was a terrific  experience  Amazon  gave close to Rs4500 of my 3 year old phone However  I must mention that my old phone had no cracks or dents so that did not diminish its value and was in a good working condition Battery life is the best part of this phone it easily lasts for 2 days with moderate usage and 1 full day if you are a gamer or a heavy user It takes close to 2½ hrs to charge fully Coming to the cons the camera is just average and you will be disappointed if you  buy the phone for the camera The 90hz is smooth Overall  I would give this phone a 910 Speaker output is low You will notice this if you consume media using phones speakerIt has a bug in touch screen out of the box Gets fixed with first updateIt doesnt have proximity sensorBattery life is the biggest positive On normal usage I get around 2 days battery life with around 11 hours screen time Good

Built quality GoodBattery 🔋is Super GoodCamera you can expect more than this from a phone costs 10kPhone is lagging too much of you have more than 15 appsVery slow performanceI am not a gamer also I dont play any single game But still the device runs slow Samsung’s M12 of a 90Hz screen is a budget phone the giant 6000mAh battery and clean UI make up for it to some extent making the Galaxy M12 a decent buyThe Galaxy M12 feels rigid and offers a firm construction There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power buttongood to see Samsung using a USB TypeC port for its affordable devices and that is present at the bottom alongside the 35mm headphone jack and speaker grille he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 65inch HD 720 x 1600 TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate In its price range the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness controlled saturation levels and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle A quadcamera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f20 aperture a 5MP secondary ultrawide lens with a massive 123degree field of view a 2MP depth and a 2MP macro sensor As far as budget phones go the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details  At night the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots I keep my expectations about lowlight photography in check from a lot of budget phones but the M12 is above average and good Lastly you get a beefy 6000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage after using the phone almost 4 months1 phone is not super fast what company is claiming infact it is slow sometimes2 If fully charged battery stays 24 to 30 hours even after heavy use but problem is with the time taken for the battery charging is toooo long so people having busy schedule will always face low in battery and searching for where to charge 🤔 15 amp charger kaun deta hain re Samsung3 M series has bad reputation for software essue but I Did not faced yet except Bluetooth sometimes turned off automatically while listening musicOverall price has dropped 1000 Rs now I bought it at 10500 Rs You can buy it sexy looks works well Honestly the phone deserves a rating of 45 deduction 05 due to certain minuses of missings like absence of dual band etcOverall the phone feels extremely premium to use with high refresh rate reasonably fast  zappy processor good primary camera etcAnother major factor to consider is that the phone is extremely well built  the weight is very evenly distributed For price  55For battery life  455For performance  45For storage  455For Camera  45But for Sound  35Now u know its good phone in this budgetI bought this in 10000 Apart from sound range its well to do phone It does not come with back cover screen guard sim slot pinCharger wire is very smallDisplay is averageOppo  Vivo displays are far better comparativelySoftware is bit laggy and not so ease of useSoftware features are not great Battery is goodBlazing fastDont read Amazon reviews at this price point this is the best fast Samsung phone you will getCamera is very good for normal use48 MPMacro mode is very goodCamera usage in low light is great8nm processor is power efficientThe new Samsung software is fast User friendly some peoples are saying about UPI PIN entering issuesbut I found it not a big issue A small part of number is not seen But still we can type Its not an issueOverall the phone is awesome Face recognition is slow otherwise the phone is super awesome My 4 months old iPhone se 2020 ran into some hardware issues due to pandemic I couldnt service it So I brought this m12 phone just to be in budget for obvious reason This phone is under 9999 and if your expecting performance similar to a 40k then your review needs a think over This phone exactly does or does more than what its priced If you are low budget and want more out of it with some limitations go for it Camera    Not Good not up to mark  48 mpBattery    GoodDisplay    Not good like local Charger with phoneNo back cover with phoneNo ear phone with phoneMany  problem  with phone  you  can say poor quality  of  product o r  below average Mon youtube and  others  they  are

PLZ SUGGEST BEST SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM AS I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR VIDEO UPLOADING PURPOSE Such a modern phone but doesnt recognize 5G bandwidth of wifi Fingerprint reader on lock button is in a very wrongfully place Phone locks and unlocks because of it So now have to register a different finger for unlocking and use different finger for locking the phone If you are looking mobile at this

reviews about the battery life and camera and went for this phone Its good on all aspects except the speaker volume Even the call ringtone is low on volume If you work in noisy environment then this phone wont suit you Even listening to songs on speaker is low on volume This is a compromise you have to make Using Samsung smartphone after many years But have to admit samsung smartphones improved a lot as compared to TouchWiz days Performance camera are very good on this device Battery life excellent All features functions as intended to be No bugs in software User experience is really great Delighted with this purchase I would say seller needs to do work with packaging 📦 and phone delivered to me in good condition but over all its goodAbout phone it is a mid range phone if you are avrage phone user so it is good choice for you 1Camera is ok 2Phone performance is ok according to this price 3Build quality is ok its fully plastic material 4about display do not expact supper hd displays

slowphone is not good please don’t buy and the most imp thing when u give it in service the just take money and do nothing I m fed up of this phone now this phone is a liability on me the camera quality is not good at all for close range its ok but for distance its 3rd classI suggest u guys never buy this phone Its been 20 days since Im using my Samsung M12 There are so many difficulties Im facing since then Its  honestly not been a good experience so far 2nd slot of the sim doesnt work most of the time so cant make requent outgoing calls from the same Every now and then Ive to Turn Off  On the Sim2 slot then only it works fine Also camera quality is pathetic One major problem is with the fingerprint sensor For 1st 10 days it was working superb but now the fingerprint  sensor mostly fails in recognising  opening the phone Also sometime my phone lags while working on multiple apps Overall Im very disappointedOnly 2 pros of this phone Low budget  superb battery backup I ordered samsung galaxy m12 in blue color I got used product with open seal I called the Amazon and they agreed to return it ThankfullyWhat I noticed about this model was it looks cheap As back is made up of cheap plastic Its very heavy which is not comfortable to use Camera quality was awful for a 48 megapixel camera Redmi camera is much better in same pixels  Its shocking and disappointingI did use this mobile so cant say anything about performance and battery life Overall its a series of disappointmentsIf you have a low budget8550 after bank discount then go for it Else I recommend micromax in 1 or any other brand with good ratings Its for normal usage best for old parents who dont need much Features Anyone other then that is a BIG NOO It’s a beast phone with a huge batteryThe UI is also very simple and the screen is very livelyCamera is good  but could’ve been betterAt this price point can’t really complain though  performance is also really for a phone priced under 15000 1 Price  Bought during GIF was one of the cheapest in this config range2 Camera  Average at best3 Battery life  Very good4 Sensors for touch  Good5 Batteries are heavy and the mob as such is heavy in hand dont keep them in loose pockets6 Browsing  Good remove all unnecessary apps during first opening and setting up the deviceOverall a good device if purchased within 9k The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The fingerprint reader is very sharpThe battery life is the best It last for almost3 days with less useThe camera is great the macro camera isnt good but the 48 MP camera is the best it works very nicely Jus the phone is a bit heavy Otherwise good The screen resolution is great Im writing this review from the same phone that I ordered An amazing phone in an affordable price I ordered the one with 6GB RAM n 128 GB internal storage overall its working quite good for me its been 10 days since I got my hands on this phonefingerprint sensor is working greatbattery life is awesome speakers are working quite good n you get quad camera camera is also pretty nice you just need to adjust the camera settings in order to get good quality pictures it might not be the best camera for many but its good guys  Overall just go for this without any second thought even if you dont like it Amazon eases your task with its 7 days replacement policy so its not risky to order it online good delivery service 👍🤗 Worst Samsung Mobile Ever used so many different Samsung mobiles but M12 is just cheating by Samsung The camera quality is so poor Its just a VGA camera not 48megapixel screen colors are very low I have a galaxy j8 its camera is lower than m12 but it is sharp dont take they will not return the product worst Samsung phone ever lost 13500 and amazon service is being poor day by day You cant really complain about anything at this price pointStill some things to point out1 Heavy as a brick 212g Will take some time to get used to2 For power users Not full one ui Uses one ui core Sound Assistant Good lock bixby dont work3 Not Amoled TFT screen4 Not a gaming phoneNow the pros1 90hz screen feels great2 48mp camera is awesome colors are good too3 Good battery 15 days backup approxOverall satisfied This is the best smartphone Samsung has launched in this segment I received it 125k with card offers and its build quality is Ok you will get the best features in this range the camera is gooe its very smooth in day to day normal useIt has a 6000mAh battery which almost lasts for around 1314Hrs in my case It takes some time in charging but if we see the battery size its normalcons you cant use s secure app to secure your  apps and folder as its not compatible with this phone and Samsung has compromised in many featuresIf you dont play heavy games you can go with this No doubt product is good but completely disappointed with Amazon because I purchased this in Great Indian Sale  10299 and next day suddenly product price shows 9499…… The main reason going for samsung is amoled display but my bad may be I should have read specifications but its a miss blindly went by brand Samsungtwo major dissapointments1 There is no amoled screenthe screen is not so good where we get lesser rate MI phones with more good specs2 Theres no dual WiFi band My wifi is set as 5ghz but this phone doesnt show upI believe there are cheaper phones in MI and Realme with more specs than this Samsung Simply an amazing smartphone from Samsung within 10k a rival killer launched Bought this for my dad and he is extremely satisfied with the performance camera is decent enough sound quality is pretty good and battery life is awesome Grip is good with the combi finish at the back On the cons a bit on the heavier side and slightly thicker compared to its rivals but definitely not a deal breaker With 90 Hz refresh rate the pros surely weigh high over the cons just go for it So heavy and thick that I have to be very careful about not dropping it on my face when in bed Screen res is low and pixels can be seen on the screen Flash light left On on level 5 can burn the phone More than usual typos on the keyboard while texting or entering OTPs Fingerprint sensor is super fast and battery back up is great The phone keeps showing a black screen with logo And doesnt allow to use the phone even after multiple  tapping on screen or trying to use the fingerprint sensor It takes almost 25 minutes for it to allow to use the phone The issue persists while tge phone is in use or even when left idle Hence the battery keeps draining I tried restarting the phone but it didnt help But the worst of all was that I switched off the phone but the phone just turned on on its own So their switch off doesnt work The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Such good features at this price range makes it a great value for money prospectPros1 Good camera quality2 phone works without any lags even when more than 3 applications are running3 Finger print on the side is a great feature and extremely useful than in screen or at the backCons1 Samsung could have invested a little more in the UI but apart from that rest is good Biggest disappointment is this latest phone  not able to connect to 5g even my old moto phone am able connect to 5g wifialso see the numeric pad display  battery life averagecheck if I can replace it with other model I was strongly buying Samsung phones and advise to friends also because of its robustness But I have worst experience with Samsung Galaxy M12 as its screen picture and camera quality are third class Even my old Mi redimi 4 phone has a better camera and screen picture although I am not promoting it  It was also the fault of amazon as they launch Samsung phones at the festival without assessing the quality and grading of products from its own professionals to check their worthiness We people buy it with the name of cos such as samsung and amazon See how we are easily deceived by amazon companyI strongly advise people that before buying products of such range pls check its quality from the market My husband gifted this phone to my Mother And she just love it As we all know Samsung is very user friendly  Any elder person who doesn’t know much about smart phones also can handle it very easily We ordered blue one And the colour is lovely too Any one who want 100 latest features with minimal cost can blindly go for it Nice phonehaving long battery life upto 2 to 3 days on one charging because of 6000mah battery its a bit heavier but fingerprint scanner is on lock key that is awesome thing I have seencamera is decent too special selfie camera bright and clearoverall nice phone Is this 48MP by Samsung The real reason why Samsung is losing to Xiaomi is this Please do not buy this if camera is important for youIt cannot detect wifi from exactly the same location from where my Samsung On7 Pro can Redmi 9 can and all others can Please note that M21 and M12 have network detecting issue Pros•Good Battery Life•Good Camera BackBetter than M11🙄•Z Plus Ramexcess ram more than 4GB IF NEEDED•90Hz adaptive refresh rate•Smooth PerformanceCons•Front Camera is Average•Too Many Useless apps When you First Buy it•Back Camera not suitable for Night condition•Saturation of Camera is Too High The phone is very goodBattery life is goodCamera is very goodTechnology is goodSamsung service is good for this good phoneOverall it a nice phone  but display quality is very poor  so this phone is good for in its price list Phone to achcha hai Main Sri lanka se par India se mangvaya rs9499 mei to value lagta hai Lkn camera 48 hone par b dooor ke fotos ki pictures quality to theek nh But selfie aur normal distance ke fotos  to theek hai Meine ise online classes ke liye kharida So iske liye theek laga Face ID to andhere me kaam nhi karta Battery bhi theek hai Abhi 5dinon se classes ke lie use kia Aur kya kahun Amazon me jo b details dekha use dekh kar kharida Ummid thodi si thi ki camera ke bare me Iske alawa overall theek hai Its just 2 days of buying this phone so overall review is not possible Few things which I want to tell about the phone It looks and gives feeling of strong built Its slightly heavier though I like such phones Battery backup is superb Camera quality is good at this price option front camera has noise in pictures which is common in low budget phones Display and sound is also justifying the price With smooth touchscreen its overall a good budget phone which gives you a feeling of premium built and fair quality My reason to buy this phone was the strong built quality and simple yet good design it does not slip from hands I got instant discount of 1000 on buying it with HDFC card The camera is of very poor qualityScreen disply quality is not good as redmi phone dont buy this phoneI will never purchase any Samsung phone in futureSamsung is only doing marketing launching new products every day but quality of the product are very poorI replaced the redi phone if you used the redimi phone you will never satisfied with Samsung I had bought this phone for my mom and it had severe call quality issues from the beginning and within 6 months of using it the fingerprint stopped working I checked with the service centre and they told me that the phone had liquid damage although it never had contact with water or rain Stay away from this garbage Total waste of money Worst camera quality Front camera is not even like like 1 megapixel camera If you like to take even a single selfi then dont go for it Back camera is also not at all good My old Samsung phones are far better than this one Once you buy you have to live with it So dont waste your money on this M12 Nice product with in the price range with better battery back up Camera quality is goodThe only bad thing I observed is that wifi is getting connected 25ghz bandwidth networks but not getting connected for 5ghz higher bandwidth networks Otherwise I would have given 5 I got this phone for my second contact number as my primary handset  battery  runs out very fast and I usually have very long days But this phones battery  really  amazed me  Its only 35 days I am using  but I can tell you that the battery  backup  is really  good  My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage Looks good  UI is simple with Android 11  Weight and grip is good  Screen is responsive  Havent faced a real show stopper as of yet  Initial opinion is full value for money for those who are looking for descent  phone with a very good battery  life It is a phone suitable for kids or those who use phone only to make calls and watch videos in youtube phone is of basic specs and cannot be used for multitaskingit can be used for basic things nothing more Loved this colorCons heating issuescreen heating while chargingdoesnt feel fast charging  adapter provided is not 15w Not feeling 90 hz refreshing rate battery drain fast  not feeling 6000 mah battery life weight is little highsound quality is not good sometimes cant hear phone ringing ProsCamera quality goodVideo quality goodNice colorGood at this price brought 10499On time deliveryHope build quality of Samsung will be good The M12 is very low quality product in terms of display which has very faded colors and the screen is a magnet for fingerprints and other forms of dirtIt does not even have high speed WiFi 5Ghz which I was expectingCompared this to very marginally higher priced M21 which is leaps ahead in terms of specs and product quality Below average phone in this price range Battery lasts only 24hrs with very normal use Camera is below standards Processor is not very impressive Mi Note 10 would have been a better choice The Phone is best for middle range buyersNegative in phone means 10002000 price has to reduce because of their given features And remaining over is fine with mid rangeFingerprint is fastBattery is very goodCamera back is okay but front 8mp is some what good because of this price has to reduceProcessor is not good for gamersThis phone is very good to who use very less or normal users   Like only calls msgs and social networks chattingIf you want camera good means dont buy this phoneScreen resolution is less due to that HD videos were not in original some what blur or like below HD There is only 1 problem I observed that  the internet is not working properly Videos are running intermittently even on high speed WiFi Web pages also does not load as expectedOther than that working fine and all the expected feature in this range Its fingerprint sensor in power button Good batry backupGood Camera  for this range i have seen all other phone in this range but samsung is the best in cameraBuildup quality is feel like mid range phoneScreen is so nice like amoledSound output is so clear and punchySamsung UI is better all other chinies smart phoneScreen is very big phone waight distribution is very comfirtyIf you wana give this phone to your love one i will 100 recomend you trust me you will never regreatI have also buy 2 quantity for personal and home usesI got it in 8549 in festive sale with HDFC credit card Worst Phone I have ever Seen with this price Nothing is good except battery Camera quality is very poor Phone is very heavy Sound quality is very poor I will never recommend to anyone to buy Samsung Phone One of my friend had recommended to go with Samsung phone I think he has no idea about the quality of phone Bad product heavy weight if you use one plus I bought this for mailing and whats app so its working ok At this price its a quality product but dont expect performance like one plus or high priced phones Battery life doesnt seems to perform like 6000 its bad People who are judging this without realizing its price needs to calm down I bought this for my cousin during Great Indian Festival at Rs 8600 Excellent product Clean Samsung UI which is the best in the world 90 Hz refresh rate which is working fine without any lag Battery backup is real good People who are saying camera needs improvement they are not gonna give you Flagship level camera in the phone which is less than 10000 Rs If you want cleaner UI you can definitely buy this  its stupidity to judge a phone by Gaming performance This phone is a daily driver  not a gaming device Samsung Galaxy M12 is an excellent handset I am writing this review after of using the mobile for three weeks The battery back up is unimaginable  Once it gets fully charged it runs for around 40 hours with frequent usage of internet This set consists every unique feature that Samsung offers The camera is good but not excellent Nevertheless the sound of loudspeaker is little down That is to say if the volume is not highest then it becomes a bit hard to listenTo conclude i would say that the configuration which this handset consists within this price range is just beyond imagination This is an excellent handset Samsung launched The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good Dont dwell on the negetive review Camera is pretty good UI is very user friendly Fingerprint sensor is at side on the lock screen button so no back side look is clean  the sensor works perfectly and flawlessly Long battery life This is good product battery life is awesome internal memory is good 128GB good for gaming is mid range mobilelttle bit heavy weight Acchi mobile hai 12 hajar ke andar game khelne k liye v best haibattery v bahut chalti haibut camera utna accha nahi hbaki sab thik h wajan thoda jyada hai Samsung is simply cheating customers by booming the non credible features  the given features are just a paper tiger  only for advertising  dont misunderstand it will perform it is just a budget phone nothing rather thanDont think against the given features by Samsung  if you need a budget phone  can buy it else if you want a performance phone please DontOnly battery is good bought on  Amazon festival sale After 10 days received phone To my surprise phone was not charging and on trouble shooting found issue in charging cable Didnt expect this quality from Samsung Delay  of delivery is pinching too I could have bought in a in person store and avoided all these hassles raised return but didnt get call even after 15days was forced to used phone and buy my own cable if something goes wrong only god can save dont trust amazon nor these vendors amazon stopped picking my support calls Galaxy M12 review after 2 weeksProsBattery lifeOperating system one ui core90hz bright displayDecent camera qualityWeight distribution was goodfeels lightDesign looks goodCons1Not sure with performanceday to day tasks are quite goodbut for gaming i think it os not suitable2Camera doesnt have fancy features but still fineFinally at low expectations i bought this product to my mom but i like it more than my phone for some timeSamsung is a brandI had disabled most of adsblotware and heavy apps in order to give best experienceBest for day to day use ☺️ Camera quality is good if compared to other phones in this range Phone feels really fast thanks to the 90Hz screen and 6gb RAM with a fast processor I bought in under exchange offer for 10000  6gb variant  and I am quite satisfied with my purchase Go for it if you are tight on a budget yet want a phone with good specs Much better than similar budget Chinese phones But note that front camera could have been better although it is 8mp but still gives grainy images Phone was delivered in perfectly new condition The weak point is camera both side is really not so good an average quality of camera but OkeySecond one is charging speed is tooo slow 15 W 😂 about 3 hours  take to full upBut I brought for my uncle so I think this was the best smartphone for himUnder 10k superb smartphoneGrate indian festival sale offer ProsGood display good battery lifeCons1 Pros are already present in other phones2 Camera quality is very bad Pictures are not very grainy and not sharp Colors look dull Photos are comparable to older nokia phone pictures3 Touchscreen is not very responsive and also not smooth4 One of the biggest con is that it does not support 5GHz wifiOverall if you are looking for budget phone i would suggest better go for redmi note seriesEven though it a budget phone it still doesnt justify its price tag There are much better phones in the market at this price range Excellent smartphone excellent picture value buy All features are excellent in this price range The picture  sound quality is very good Only problem is the charging port is not universal Thus I have bought a charging cable only Otherwise excellent The fingerprint sensor is on mode button it is not comfortable Lightly stuck the back touch button Camera quality is not in 48 pixel and front not goodIt is over the look not good and fully not bad But I am not satisfied the amount of worth Please dont buy thisThe data conctivity was really terribleAnd I tried changing Sim card to my old phoneIn old ph the data was connecting good and speed also goodAnd while I am in voice call when I turn on the speaker only the other can hear my voice if I off speaker they are unable hear my voiceWorest product😢😢😢Please dont go with thisNo screen recorder no shortcut yo screenshot but unwanted apps will download without our permission from galaxy storeBack camera is also not up to the markVery very bad experience Good to go pieceFew cons which I have noticed• Specs may say camera megapixels are higher but not in par with MI phones• Cannot run dual apps for applications other than messenger• Sudden issue arised in first week of use where speakers started screaming harshly with noise trrrrrrrr whenever some sound playednotifications music Luckily resolved after a reboot saw some other users having similar issues over support forum Samsung M12  Camera clarity is absolutely worst and bad normal Camera phone is better than  And  mobile is  getting over heated  badly  in all times when Iĺ operate over all Samsung M12 performance is not goodi purchased this mobile for camera purpose I just blindly trusted Amazon before buying Samsung M12 now in not happy with thisOne of Best Worst mobile in Samsung seriesAmazon thought me very  good lesson purchasing mobile from them never ever I wont purchase anything in Amazon  By these Amazon heir trusted  and confidence  🙏🙏🙏 Thanq I have been using this phone for last 2 monthsThe battery backup of this phone is too good It lasts for 2 or 3 days with low usage Camera is goodThe fingerprint sensor responds quicklyIn this price range it is worthy Horriblebought  this phone on launch datecamera quality is worstand the performance is below average Dont waste your money by buying  thisSince I brought  it under replacement policy not able to return  it now Worst phone from samsung Hi friends dont purchase this phone with any expectationProblem1 Phone over heating during while charging2 Camera not equal to 48 MP3 Finger print reader not upto markIts on ordinary phone under 10kReally disappoint with this product Samsung failed to maintain their standard Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome 1655 cm infinity V display is cool In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery Unnecessary samsung apps which you cant uninstall If you are not tech savvy you are gonna face lot of problems All the unnecessary apps will be automatically downloaded There are pre installed apps you neither can uninstall nor block notificationsCamera is worst in this price range No fast charging opting available Battery life is good Finger print reader is ok Mobile is too bulky and thickness is too much 97 mm Not looking like modern phone Samsung pls work on weight and thickness Customer wont require big battery give 5000mah is enough Give some modern look with max 85 mAh thickness talk about procesdor its entry level processor of 67 k phones But u give in 11k phone atleast use G35 If youre not a heavy gamer or user you can definitely go for this this is a budget phone and excellent for running moderate and lit apps for our daily use  and there will be no lag and have a very good battery life  camera is average and UI is good Please everyone attention dont but this Mobile because this Mobile is not good battery backup same as 5000 mah battery  and I used 6000 mah battery other Mobile tecno spark 7t that Mobiles Mobile battery is more batter than m12And camera quality is very  bad experience in this mobile only name is 48 mega pixels  but quality is 16 mega pixels  aur front camera is very poorPlease everyone dont buy this mobile I you want to buy please but tecno spark 7t same features in this Mobile I wanted to have a phone 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM and 7000 mAH battery with large display and good picture quality in budget This phone has satisfied me a lot however this phone has 6000 mAH battery I am much satisfied now After one year or more than one year It should not be slow and hang I will rate this phone 8 number out of 10However its a better deal 13 to 14 k you will get better than this Samsung m12 The day I started use phone started hangingI should honestly give the reviewGo for other phone it doesnt give 6000mah woser than my old Lenovo phone 3500mahCamera is average they give lots number of MP but not suited at all  only good thing is finger print senso even that too I doubt about it how long days I can have without problemFinally I m not satisfied with M12 6GB Ram phone is not working as the attractive description given below the list Hopeless product Quite disappointed with the phone Recently bought Already the battery charging is very slow The camera is mediocre It lacks night mode and the picture quality is average Colours are not rue to colour Will not recommend this phone As a regular smartphone user i will rate this item 4 out of 5 because in such price it should be much better like in 48 mp camera the picture quality is not as good as my expectation Fingerprint and face unloch is quite good and the selfie camera really excellent As 6000mAh battery the battery should last upto 1day and a half but in standard use the battery quality decreases upto 29 in the evening I charged the phone around 640 am on that day This problem that I faced I had share with you all guys before buying this phone please think a lot and tge decisions is completely upon you Thank You Arnab Bindu Chakraborty Amazing battery life Discharge is only 1 for overnightDisplay can be much better Expected a better display from samsung Vivo and oppo have a better display interms of brightness and pixel densityFinger print on power button is good and quickPlastic back is kind of disappointingOverall performance is ok but not what the ADS on amazon show you Dont see the negative reviews  After using 10days I am writing this reviews Back camera excellentFront camera okBattery excellentCharging Full for 230 hours approxLittle more weight but not so heavyDisplay excellentNo heating  no hangingVolume and speakers excellentAround 10k budget excellentSamsung is best brand and provenThanks to Amazon Actually I am a fan of samsungI brought this variant with 11k  diwali offerI thought to buy other mobile instead of Samsung in this price where I can get additional features but surprisingly samshng m12 made me feel good after buying this phoneMain thing is performance no lag even I am playing asphalt 9 Ram management is super and samsung UI  is great experience  as you can see in high end mobilesCharging is fast and long lastDisappointed thing is only 📷Totally I am 😊 with this 📱 in this price RangeRecommended and for it As of now 6gb varaint is about 14k wait for drop 11k and proceed Bought this for my parents and they love it As I am using A52 myself I feel M12 delivers at its price range and then some The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate Having 90 Hz Adaptive display is wonderfulCamera is decent as well with options for Macro attached and Wide Angle being good as well Havent experienced any lags on medium workloadsAndroid 11 with updated UI Smart View Dolby Atmos Good Battery Life are some highlightsVery satisfied with the purchase The battery life is way better than any of the smartphone in the same range and the person is also good as it has 6 gb ram but camera quality can be little bit better and they could have improved the processor Good thing is that all apps are optimised which is good for the battery life Its a great product if you are a kind of person who wants a smartphone which has a longer battery life a good speed and 90hz refresh rate and who doesnt do gaming in the smartphone i feel like cheated by amazon and samsung its not even a month and my phone stopped working with no reason this was not expected and visited to samsung centre as well but they were saying that only non warranty sets are getting fixed during this lockdown period then i asked them to fixed my set out of warranty i was ready to pay as well then they said that your mobile display is need to be change and there is no display available in India for my phone and from that day i am not having any smartphone as i am saving money and trying to bear this pain n lossamazon hats off to u cheaters Got this as a replecement for my samsung M11 The M12 is way better than M11 Better photo quality better performance and faster performance I got the blue phone which looks decent as well I feel its worth the 13500 I paid for it The phone received in a day Thanks Amazon for quick delivery The phones display camera battery life is good But one issue I found it Recently I realize it that once I receive incoming call am not able hear it for couple of minutes  sometimes no voice heard from other side and finally I need to close the call initially I thought this issue should be from sender phone but now I realize it is in my phoneit appears that either there is problem in my phone or in model Samsung and Amazon to look into this issue  replace it with good phone on immediate  basis  battery life is super camera quality is ok in such price segment bought this phone at 8599  with 1039 rs credit card discount build quality  is best Not amoled display but at this price you dont deserve amoled it is an hd display but u deserve new android 11 but it is based on android 10 and needed the  one ui  updated version My old phone m30 is 2 year old but it has awesome features in  one ui  but this has not  hope software update gave all this features  But battery life is awesome and camera is average 🙂🙂 Phone is fabulous and it is worth for those who r looking the budget phone All features are loaded un customise manner in this phone One should nit go for 15k range

compared to other 12k to 15k M series budget phones The phone is good Of course it justifies its price range But this phone has a low audio outputso putting a speaker during callor while playing other media files the sound is not very high even when kept at full volume Other than that the phone is great After 1 month use some serious sensors are missing which will make google maps almost useless on the phone Camera quality is good only for day time that too depends on mood of the camera Sluggish phone you can see phone saving photo even after quiting the camera app Serious processor problems I bought 6128 variant and felt sorry for whoever bought 4 gig version Good for minimal users and for saving tonns of photos via apps but not from the phones camera BGIM was surprisingly good on the phone thanks to its large screen Also good for online classes and OTT viewers Literally value for money in this prize by SamsungI could blindly recommend you this phone if you are samsung

M12 design and display but its also good not bad I am writting this review after using this mobile for almost 2 monthsWhen connected my laptop via mobile Hotspot through this phone it drops off for every 20 minutes I have to restart the mobile then need to connect again It is very annoyingI didnt have this problem with my previous mobile and also I dont have any coonectivity issues with my wifes mobile if I use mobile Hotspot on it Mywifes mobile is lesser in configuration when compared to this mobile We both have same mobile connection which is VodafoneI dont know what to to do This is my solid rankingafter using Galaxy M12 for a fortnightOvweall performance is quite good and comfortableIt would be better if atleast 25 w charger is provided with a big batterySome critics on you tube had informed  4 to 5 problems in all M series phones but I have found none of them in this product although it is of very reasonable priceI am 85 today and yet enjoy my ph Without any difficultySAMSUNG has never any excuse I bought this phone before 2 months Camera is very poor 48 MP it is poorer than 13 MPI wanted to login my company email before that device needs to be enrolled with Microsoft Intune company portal The company portal will only allow when Device encryption feature will be available in phone but it does not haveThis is very important hardware features that secure your phones data So this phone is use less for me to configure outlookSo GuysBe aware if you are buying any phone and which phones price is falling day by day The media could not be loaded\\n

and design so i think u should not buy this phone because there are a lots of more option in this price range from micromax redmi poco realme i bought IT for 9000 in sale Phone does not support 5 GHz band for wifi due to this slow internet compared to my old phonePhone is not at all slim thick phoneIt has a 6000Mah battery but still it drains very fast compared my old oppo F11Camera performance is just okayFinger scanner is placed on the side of the body not comfortable to usePhone is without screen guard and back cover brand could have provided in the box it would have not added much cost to them In this price range for the moment one of the best deals 6000mAh battery really does the job Fingerprint reader is sensitive but if you using mobile with cover it becomes difficult due to its position Camera not great not terrible Touch sensitivity is not that great sometimes it slides when I want to open an app but not that major problem If you want something with high battery and RAM and storage this is the mobile Finger print reader  camera quality excellent It senses quickly  good resolution as far as camera is concerned Battery life depends on usageMoreover From my experience  Samsungs after sale service is excellent This phone is no different from other Samsung phones with respect to the usage speed While the battery is fantastic camera is ok There too much lag while using phone The worst thing is I noticed all these after my return period is over I am using this phone since 5 months and overall performance is good but camera is not like 48 mega pixels  when you take a picture the picture is cracked not clear visibleBattery life is very good 2 day backups in normal use and day in gaming use Using it for about 4 months now Heavy phone although has plastic body works fine storage is great charges fast Not yet facing any difficulty Overall the mobile is great at this price although screen is not as bright  speaker is just above average not as loud as required battery is very good and goes on for  more than one and half day easily camera is good and you can click some very good and bright photos Overall good option in this price range  best feature is it has 6gb ram 128 gb internal memory at this price The touch is bad The mobile is heavy Battery is good Also fast charge Camera is good outdoors But low light and indoor quality is not great Overall not bad Okay for regular use Not for photography or playing games अमेज़न मेने आपके ऐप्प सेsamsung M126GB Ram 128 GB Rom6000 MH बैटरीका फ़ोन खरीदा आपसे कोई शिकायत नहीहैपरSamsungसे शिकायत है में पिछले 2 साल सेJ6 इस्तेमाल कर रहा हैबहुत अच्छा और मजेदार फ़ोन हैबस बेटरी कम है बाकी उसके फंक्शन एक दम अच्छे और usefull हैM12 से में ना खुश हूं When I received the mobile neither the speaker nor the mic was working so I did a restart then it started workingThis happened frequently so I had to restart frequently I decided to replace the item as it was faulty but the new product I received has the same issue Unfortunately this is not returnable so my money is wastedVery bad experience please avoid buying this Handset is likeable no doubts But the quality of display camera and processor are not full in criteria as mentioned I have sent a picture captured by 48 mp resolution you will see that is not clear and  proof that the quality of camera is not good Display resolution shows to see the diaplay you need to tilt the phone Sometimes phone went hanged also so that the processor is not good I have exchanged my old phone which was in well running condition now I am missing that was best against this one That was solid in his promises Thankyou Using it from last 8 months worth it totally 👍 used iPhone earlier and then bought this phone one thing noticed is battery life no comparison at all with iPhones way better than iPhones and many smartphones of this rangeSecond one is Screen resolution top qualityThird pro is storage better than iPhoneCamera is average compared to iPhones and other smartphones so if you want good smartphone with good battery life storage screen resolution then must go for this phone Totally worth it in this criteria Not worth of moneyNot aviled for any special futureIts does noteven have the normal features that other mobile have😔😔😔😔😔 1 A good phone in this range2 Exynos 850 may not sound a great processor for gaming or multitasking but it actually does a great job3 No heating issues Playing games like FF for 12 hrs or attending consecutive meetings on Meet Zoom  Teams or doing consecutive classes on Unacademy or Adda wont cause a problem4 Although the camera quality disappointed me as their remains a high expectation from Samsung Cameras5 But overall Samsung lives upto its name with great service centres and customer support As Samsung shows its quality in every launch this is also a good product in mid range mobiles All things are good if u r an average user for high performance gaming  photography other high end models are preferred A good buget phone with great battery lifeI usually use it for gaming because I cant buy a gaming phone it to expensive But I can play seemingly all kind of game without lagI dont mean games like genshin imapactOverall goodValue for money810 reason low resolution  comparedd to other  budget smart phone  under 12000Camera910 under this price tag the camera  qualityy is goodChipset810under this price tagBattery1010best in this price tagOverall710 Battery life is very good Built quality is also very nice Camera quality also very good Fingerprint reader work perfectly and also fast Overall the phone is very good Value for money One of the best choice this phone in this price range One UI 31 and 90hz display makes the user experience heavenly It has a 8nm processor and really power efficient Without compromising in the perfomance it gives me more than 2 days of battery life Camera is decent and the colour reproduction is very goodNo hanging or heating problemsIt can run high end games in low to medium settings as well but I wont recommend this for gaming purposeLots of features included with the One UI 31 core which I liked the most Overally a great phone for Normal users 👌 MIc is not working properly I already bought M31 same problem with that mobile also   My mistake is forgot that purchase and again same series phone since have good confidence over Samsung but they never maintaining good quality   They need lot improvement over testing the product before launching in market Another good product from Samsung Galaxy M12  Battery life is very good Performance is not as good as Qualcomm Snapdragon but its ok Only you will find performance difference when you play games Features are excellent Camera Quality also good Value for Money in this range Best Battery Rear Camera And fast finger print unlockBut Samsung Galaxy M12 its Not Support Wifi Dual Band 5GHzOnly Support Single Band 24GHzOverall its Best Only Under Rs 8500 I have purchased this on 6th sep with 6 months free screen replacement My phone screen broke in a month and when i go back to samsung service center they denied for screen replcement Also samsung customer care is saying amazon will do it Amazon is saying samsung will do itThey are making fool of customers Satisfied with product Camera quality is okay Other than that its a samsung whoever is used to samsung will love the functioning of this device tooIf you are a samsung lover definately go for it If you are conscious about new features gaming camera quality other options might be available at given price point Its great for day to day tasks and surfing internet social media and all Thumbs up for Samsung Just stopped working after few hoursIt seems it has a bug It doesnt work for quite a few hours in the evenings Not sure how long I buy my first ever  may be last Samsung Phone because mobile phone is good for daily use only the issue which I was noticed when I trying to connect internet   opened mobile hotspot  connected my laptop or other device  the speed of internet showing below 100 kbsec it’s very worst  even I connected my same laptop  other devices with another mobile and same network it’s showing speed above  500kbsec the thing is only disappointed me Its total value for money It can handle regular usage like social media video streaming very well fingerprint unlock is pretty fast Camera and display are on bit downside but to be realistic at this price range its pretty decent Go for it if you are looking alternative of low cost chinese I dont know why they have mentioned as 48 mega pixel  I am big fan of SamsungPrior to this mobile I have used Samsung j6 its just 13mega pixel camera quality is just awesome M12 camera quality is very poooooorOne more issue is Amazon not accepting return until if you receive a defective piece The phone is a good one to use It is a 65 inch but is handy to use for its balance It has a 6000 mah battery which gives it a great battery backup with a decent fast charger It has also a good UI One UI 30 Overall its a good smartphone which can beat some flagship phone too Well if the question comes what I dislike  about  the phone is absolutely  nothing  it is a proper handy phone allows  to have a well grip The quad camera  allows  to take  a full depth  of a picture enrich  in color and to take a true tone photo The finger print is fast like thunder like a touch of your finger and opens in front  of you The battery  is cool to use you could  say a PowerBar with phone and the make and feel of the phone is like your bide on the wedding night A cool phone to use and recommend  others Nothing  found against except it is  a little bulky and plastic on back is ordinary but it is budget phone and can not be compared with S21 or I phone It is good for above ordinary use with occasional gaming Battery easily last for more than two daysI can say you get more than you pay photo In day light is very good uploaded photo is in low light at around 6 pmMovies on Netflix were enjoyable with good sound and colour I have received the product today but as mentioned box in the details while purchasing in the box available hand setmanual ejection pinadopter In the box only I have received hand set and adopter not received the manual and ejection pin Without ejection pin how should I put my SIM card in my mobile I am very unhappy with that Still I am not checking the other details in the phone I am rated 1 star out of 5 bcoz of above issue First impression is best impression here I am not seen very in happy Just Go For ItGreat Value Awesome Product Great Service Samsung is the real deal 👌👌👌Better than the Advertisement6GB Ram 6000 Battery Good Screen Decent Processor Every thing you need to do Is but a Breeze for M12Last but not the least KNOX Security You can Trust Samsung with your lifeI am thankful and grateful to Samsung for a great companion 👍 Regretful encounter wth this M12 order  dated 14 th Aug 21Gifted this product to my sister its been just 3 mths today Display not working unable to start n poor battery performanceShowed at Samsung gallery for review they said mother board needs to b changed whc will cost 8 kPlease do justice to the lil investments we make aroundKindly oblige acknowledge n respondNeed full replacement to considerTeam Amazon n collabs I am using this phone from 5 days on this basis I am just giving my feedback1 Fingerprint reader is different as compare to other Android phones and its take some time to detect Fingerprint2 Rear Camera quality is good but its not like 48 mega pixels3 Battery backup is good but its charge slowly4 Overall performance is good with this price Best phone in this price rangePros1 Camera is best in class The photos clicked are so great in quality2 Phone is fast as anything Even the heaviest of apps open in a jiffy3 Fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone in less than a second4 Colour and looks are so pleasantCons1 Display is okay somewhat yellowish2 Phone is a little bulky and heavy on hand I like the focus mode that helps to keep apps that are needed active to avoid unwanted notifications to distract ones work Dark mode and eye protection is also good feature that protects eye Inbuilt Smart mode helps detect the fraudspam calls without any external app installation Camera quality is good with good zoom capability Phone is light and slim with good responsive touch sensor Overall Phone is very good for my purchase budgetof Rs9500 Its a great phone from Samsung in budget series I will not waste your time nor mineso coming to the point all things are positive so Im gonna tell you negative fingerprint reader is on the side on power button Its just okay quality And other thing is cameras are also good but front one is just OK But overall in this price range its awesome and if you are confused between redmi 10 and Samsung m12  just go for itIts just great and above all its Samsung 😉 Slighly bigger than M10 M21 amd M31 Other than 6 GB Ram 128 GB storage and 6000 MaH battery everything is ordinary They could have given a better screen for this price Even charging cable is shorter than optimum Touchscreen issues Display issues Bad Hardware and Delay in Mobile When brough mobile normal apps looks finme still slow display but few apps like phone pe etc these keys are not matching and responses are slow overal display issues and touchscreen issues are there  unfortunately i installed phone pe and found this issue after return window and now not sure what needs to be done very bad display and touchscreen not worth to buy this mobile I tried all updates etc within 78 days have issues  Touch is extremely bad and is irritating as it doesn’t recognize and hangs upHave to lock and unlock several times to get other apps workingWhen phone is locked despite double  triple tapping the screen it doesn’t light up or show option to unlock we have to press the side button yo light the screen which is more frustratingExtremely slow even though it’s 4 gb ram If you are interested in a budget camera phone this one isnt for youThis phone is pretty smooth Works for people who dont use phones much like meBattery life is awesome and Im enjoying it but cable is a bit shortOverall good phone would recommend this one if u are really low on budget but if you can spend a bit more just get the Samsung m30s or m31This phone just needs improvement in camera and otherwise this is a decent budget phone The mobile comes with lots of bloatware Needs to be trimmed Also the contact list is not easy to use when a name has more than 1 contact Most importantly searching thru various notifications is difficilt Privacy is at risk because the pictures keep changing everytime one presses the power button to start  which means all our actions are being recorded somewhereI do not use thw Fingerprint reader but still it is asking to rate So gave 1 star raring The Camera is not good it feels like a 13 MP not 48MP the battery life is normal it will last 1 day easily and will charge the full battery in 3hrs but the phone is heavy more than 2000 grams and I have also tried COD Mobile in medium setting the 90hz refresh rate help in gaming and the overall gaming experience is fine I would suggest you to go for this phone if you are only a normal user it is not made for heavy gaming Average phone at this range phone gets hanged while using some basic apps Battery life is ok doesnt seem like 6000mah which makes phone heavy  camera quality is average Only best thing  about the phone is its lookAll together I feel you can get a better phone at this price i love samsung ab jab redme ke hi parige me samsung mil raha haj to zabardsti ka add wala phone lene ka kya faida samsung lo This review is after using phone for 1 weekLikesUnder 10k budget  this phone is very good to use its having  almost features like a 1415k phonecamera quality is also goodMy usage of phone is more would say whole day so by the EOD I left with 2030batteryDislikeswhat I was in need of I dint get that is Wificalling option in this phoneMain drawback is if battery reaches below 40 50 it takes really long time to get fully charged up I am using this for more than a month as of now This is a very good Product at the price which Samsung is selling It says it is MADE IN INDIAI really like the Battery Backup for me it is lasting for more than 30 hours with moderate uses Like  Youtube   calling and Hotspot usesCOns  It is Bulking and feels heavy in pocketFinger print scanner is not up to the mark  some times it is unable to unlock  इस फोन में कई कमियां है जैसे इसकी नोटिफिकेशन ट्यून बंद करने पर भी नोटिफिकेशन आने पर बजती है।इसको चार्ज़िंग पर लगाने और फोन के चार्ज होने का कोई भी संकेत नहीं मिलता है।नोटिफिकेशन से सम्बंधित प्रकाश संकेत इसमे उपलब्ध नहीं है जिससे स्क्रीन लॉक होने पर नोटिफिकेशन की जानकारी नहीं हो पाती है।भार में भी ये अन्य फोनो से काफी ज्यादा है।कैमरा तो चार चार है पर पिक्चर की गुणवत्ता संतोषजनक नहीं है।वाई फाई की रेंज बहुत ही कम है एक दीवार के बाद डाउनलोड की स्पीड अत्यंत कम हो जाती। Mere life ka sabse khrab anubhavMai aap Sab se kahunga is samsung M12 mobile ko kabhi mat lena  Galti se bhi

delivered a malfuncted phone to meDisappointed by Amazon atleast you should do quality check for the product your selling Complete waste of time and waste of moneyIf there is option for negative star I will definitely give that alsoDisappointed Camera ia average but for decent activity this is really a good buy Current 6gb varient is available for 10500 after applying offers is a great deal you can definitely buy it But not for heavy users I ordered this product on 20 July 2021 and immediately it got delivered within a week on 29 July 2021Mobile camera is goodBattery is betterPerformance and storage is goodOverall its good mobile for normal android usersThis review is not for  users who play high end games like ping free fire etc in mobile First impressionsPros  2 days battery life if internet is used constantlyRAM is enough to handle the heavy apps smoothlyRuns on latest Android version and Samsung UIConsSo so camera quality as compared to similar price range products Overall in this budget the phone is okPrimary camera is good but doesnt seems to be true 48 mp If youre a selfie lover then dont buy this phone because the front camera is worstDecent battery life can lasts upto 1 and a half day with average useProcessor saw some improvements asphalt 9 and call of duty is running alright but not smooth 90 mhz screen is a pure lie by the samsung the TFT display is poorly managed on the hardware Fast charging is there I am so glad to say you that phone was delivered at fully boxed and wrapped around phoneAs I using phone the battery performing above my expectationsCamera is taking stunning pictures as I wishFingerprint sensor are working good but not like otherScreen touch also as smooth as the velvet touchPhone is working at awesome speedy Mic Quality in video is extremely bad Cannot explain how bad it is I ordered 2 phones at my home both of them have this same issue Samsung needs to address this immediately I dont want to talk about other features as this is budget phones But never seen such a bad quality from this or lower price range Nothing extra ordinary about this phone There are much better options in this price rangeThe battery is definitely good and lasts more than a full dayHowever on the down side the phone is very heavy camera is ordinary and it feels sluggish to use For this price it is a good phone Bit heavy but battery life is good so cant complain there Camera is okay not so great If you are looking for a good camera then u might not want this phone Rest it is a good phone 3 months use review  no voice recording tool no screen video capture tool its usually available on any cheap phone Samsung says these are available on higher end models who is a snobGiven 3 stars overall just because of the plastic at the back during the call it vibrates  cheap plastic casing otherwise phone works fine Other phones cheaper than this have better casing but then got this ph 9999 in offer the touch sensor are really bad especially face recognition which never recognizes meapplication opening processor speed with min 5 applications and battery life are good Nice product from samsung  I purchased it a few weeks back from Amazon with nice offer and exchange offer  Phone is great for daily routine task  I am using banking with Knox security and never felt any disappointments regarding thisIt is not for gaming purpose  Its a value for  money good battery life  nice big screen  moderate camera for daily purpose  Overall its 5 out of 5 from my sideI wold like to say thanks to Amazon to give a reliable service  It feels good in handScreen is not very impressive  as advertisedBattery life is goodMain Camera is average Front camera is goodIt is easily handling both my personal and work environments I dont see any lagOver all it is a very good purchase at this pricePS  not able to find a good back cover as most of the available ones are manufactured for galaxy A12 They fits to M12 but feels like not perfect This phone is having all good features and its finger print reader and face recognizing is working superSound and battery  life is goodCamera superAnd all other phone feature are compare to 30k ir provided in thisA big thanks to Samsungloving it Display is HD with TFT panel but it doesnt feel like TFT rather it feels IPS LCD HD panel Good move Samsung But other brands providing IPS LCD FHD 90hz in this 12k segment from Other brands But initially its good 1 month since I bought it excellent all rounder Great performance fast nice camera for d priceBattery is too good easily lasts 2 days with medium usageI dont play games so cant comment on Game performanceCamera is not d best but for this price I didnt expect much Daylight pictures are really great Video quality is also good I liked the battery backup of the phone and performance is so far good as it is being used by my parents BEST phone for parents Takes 2 hours to go from 0100 And please dont buy this phone if you are photogenic or require gaming efficiency Mobile is nice5 star in Battery Life5 star in other specs4 star in camera35 star in optimizationThe optimization is bad due to OneUI Samsung hasnt made a good UI It is not optimised The camera is betterbut it dont have more modes while its competitor Redmi 9 Power have nice camera modes This mobile is best in all types just the Camera and OneUI is not good I used in and really the feelings was great It is smooth no hang or down occours Storage and new camera facility was just good and little bit mora upgarde to the camera needed I think Slow motion operation  Over experience was great You all have to try it once For gamers it may little not good as the processor is getting some lapse while using heavy gamesMy experience was best because with this amount the mobile provides a lot At this price I expect atleast a little better phone First of all the processor is slow and lagging The camera quality is very bad I mean very bad so think about what are the essential things you definitely need before buying Battery life is fine Look is average because its quite thick than other models Overall I think its okay for general purposes but not a good phone to have I bought the phone yesterday There is a problem with the display and image quality view in this phone Images appers yellowish and dull I am thinking of returing the phone I think this product is not bad Those who dont want to take a lot of selfi but want to use Phone for call to listen music and to watch videos  they can try this M12 Yes Phone looks slightly heavy but overall good in this price range I have purchased a samsung M12 mobile and 6 months free screen replacement warranty added for prime member at that I am also prime member so this benefit addedAfter 2 week mobile was Fall down and screen was damagedSo I went to samsung service center and claim the warranty but my mobile insurance plan was not activated so you will be bay and change the screenLast 25 days I am try to activate my plan but problem was solved upto dateSo please solve the problem quickly Bad in charging  not a fast charging  phone take 4 to5 hours for chargingAlso battery back is not good enough  drained in 8 hours similar as my earlier  phone Screen display also not up to mark  pixels  are averageSound quality  in both speakers is bad  voice clarity  not goodAlso phone is slow while operating  taking pause while usingThere are  good option other brands at similar  prices I always think 10times before I order anything expensive from Amazon because I have got a bad product But this time dont know why I didnt give a thought This model of Samsung M12 was available in Amazon only and guess what I received manufacturing defective piece Seems like Amazon is pleasing customers by making things available in advance which turn out to be defective Samsung also does not take responsibility of replaceling their defective piece with a new one There is a Bluetooth connectivity issue in Samsung M12 mobile and it also not supports 5G Big drawback for this product I never expected from Samsung that this type of issue will come with phone I dont know why bluetooth is not supporting to all device Please provide the Bluetooth connectivity solutions Havent used it for too long but from the current usage these are the observations1 Battery life is good  used it to stream movies and music but still worked out fine2 Camera is ok again based on specs for the price range3 Would have liked better packaging and a back cover atleast Brought this phone in Apr 2021  kept it for charging when the battery was down and after after hours the display was gone  Don’t suggest anyone to buy this phone  Ive been using this for some days now and I have to say its been great The phone is really sleek and screen resolution is very good Camera is excellent in Good lighting Under poor light or night time it may not do so well Phone is really beautiful though 6Gb128 GB phone was much slow than my old phone of 2Gb 32GbDont go by specifications only performance not matching for this modelThanks to Amazon for returning the product The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Gaming wise very poor Uhhthe fingerprint scanner is good but i am not a fan of side mounted fingerprint scannerso thats why the 4 stars otherwise everything is fine looking at the price though the phone is a bit heavy and bulkier than my other phones Overall its the best phone for the price range Battery life is a blast sometimes I can go without charging for 2 days on a 23 hour screen time If you start the day at 100 after heavy use you will still be left with the battery at the end of the dayThe camera is pretty good too but not great Id say a 45 for the cameraThe phone is kinda heavy if you are not used to heavy phones then take care for the first 12 weeks At this cost this phone is awesome Camera Screen Battery everything is awesome However on careful inspection some sensors are missing when compared to Xiaomi and other Chinese brands There is no option for WIFI 50 Ghz in this phone Nowadays almost all of us have dual band Wifi router in our homesoffices But this phone will only work with lower speed and lower bandwidth 24 Ghz It cannot detect the higher bandwidth 50 Ghz so you wont get higher Wifi speed ProsBattery stays more than a day at a full recharge Usage  mediumNew sensors for motion gesturesViewing angles niceCamera  decentConsSlightly thicker nd weigherAfter two days it wasnt noticeableVerdict Go for it Worst UI experience from samsung1 Basic app lock setting missing2 Data disconnected while in a call3 While using Amazon custome care chat keyboard hide the typed content4 SMS selects the recent caller option missing5 You cant off the alarm for one particular day You have to off then on the alarm again5 Unnecessary samsung apps occupy the space which you not even open in your lifetime Since my colleague is using this phone for the past 20 days he is extremely satisfied with the product be its battery life camera quality or display The thing which he miss is the Samsung Earphoneheadphones which should have been provided with it thus cutting one star for this Else everything is okay A phone working good with all app except high end gaming app or some high processor occupied apps Phone get switched off automatically on high processor usage when multi app functioning Good at 85k priceCamera quality very good without zoom Very bad with full zoom Same with selfi camNetworking  zero problems till nowRest is good till now in last 1 month from i bought Good bettry life so mobile is bit heavyNot a best camara but fine in this range and its not 48MP totally fakeOverall good for parents who needs bettry life and not photoholic Fingerprint reader not worked properlyIf you unlock  you device 10 times its perfectly  work only 6 timesPHONE PAY GOOGLE  PAY

recommend spend an additional INR 45K and get M31Couldnt return Very poor quality phone Camera and display quality is very poor Poor than even 2 mega pixels cameraDisplay quality is worsed  Totally use less productDoesnt meet any quality as advertised by samsung I dont want to give even 1 star to this phoneThis is worst product of samsungI want to return this phoneAmazon please return this phone Complete package truly its a Monster Reloaded Everything from Camera to Speed to Interface is perfect Only negative thing is that its bit thick  heavy Its a Made in India Product Light weight lovely colourUI is goodCamera settings had to be changed as the default picture quality was set to 5MP After a software update I could change it to the right MP 6 months screen replacement for prime means third party is providing replacement for prime members only within a certain prime day offer periodIn case anyone want replacement have to contact or raise a request through for replacement Third party will do the needful accordingly Within six months its dead never ever buy samsung mobile sorry I never expected this from samsung its rebooted again and again all please avoid samsung they didnt do RD properly Their is no negative rating option so i have to give 1 rating to this junk phone  DONT BUY this device after 5 day only its screen become blank tried all possible trouble shooting available online but this junk phone didnt recover Finally i have to go to service centre and from their also pathetic response i have to visit 3 different service centre to get this repair Didnt except such a pathetic product from Samsung Nice product I like it so much battery life is too good I do not drain more the 50 of battery after heavy usage Camera quality is good processor is so amazing for day to day usage fingerprint works pretty well charing speed is normal Overall nice product for day to day usage And thanks flipkart for so delivery very I ordered it on 18032021 and get it one 20032021 Thanks flipkart again for fast delivery and a value for money and budget phone in only 11000 rupees The fingerprint sensor is very fast 90hz display quality is good smooth touch and nice colour production Battery backup is awesome can play games specially PUBG in HD  easily without lag but the portrait sensor is not so impressive its just somewhat good 48mp and other lenses are also awesome they capture really impressive imagesOverall the mobile is very good  If you have lower budget and about a trustworthy brand  then go for it Even YouTube videos are running screen getting turned off automatically and sound goes normal This problem is happening unevenly I have used very gently as it new device and I facing this problem Please dont waste your money here be careful with what you are getting 100 battery charging takes 3hrs of time were slow changing but the battery life is wow its super camera quality is super its just been 3days if any other issues I will update my review in future So impressed with the battery backup and display is good with a great refresh rate value for money product that too in a great price Using this phone along with my S21 Ultrabut still i love this Battery backup superCamera quality well But the macro option worst Selfi just low qualityProcessing speed goodsome specification are like to 6000rs mobile phoneFace lock fingerprint lock are very quickly workingOverall it is monster Best mobile Except WiFi network connectivity others things are goodThis phone  other company phone kept side by side for testing WiFi signal catch other company phone WiFi signal connect very fast all time but this Samsung M12 failed maximum  maximum  maximum time to catch WiFi signalVery much disappointed with Samsung M12 ☹️☹️☹️☹️ Amazon didnt allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock something very fishyHeating problem It doesnt work with 50GHz WiFi frequency 24GHz is very old schoolCamera quality is pathetic both front and back Forget about 48MP pictures are all blur poorer than a 4MP one घण्टा true 48 megapixel कैमरा है 🔔🔔🔔🔔कैमरे की क्वालिटी 2G के समय जो चाइना फोन आते थे उसके 2 mp के जैसी है ।फोन में दमदार बैटरी के अलावा कुछ भी नही है ।इस प्राइस रेंज में दूसरे मोबाइल इससे ज्यादा फीचर और अच्छी क्वालिटी में मिल जाते है ।पता नही क्यो अमेज़ॉन कस्टमर रिव्यू में ज्यादातर लोगों ने 1 स्टार दिया है फिर भी अमेज़न इसको ओवरऑल 45 स्टार क्यो दिखाता है  The mobile is good When the users switches on the mobile for the first time it finds it too hard to answer all the preloaded questions or confusionsI ordered the mobile  I am going to use the mobile and the additional apps choices should be mine Numerous unnecessary additional apps are preloaded I was forced to uninstall all the additional apps that was preloaded unnecessarily Very Horrible Camera  was totally disappointed with the camera  very poor camera and bad service by Amazon which made my life miserable in exchanging this product I have bought many mobiles earlier and now i will not buy from this site as exchange replacement is very difficult Think twice before you buy the same RedmiRealme phones offers much better specs in this price bracketSamsung mobile having Exynos processor is known for its lagging performance when compared with those having much lower spec SnapDragon processors Here same case with M12 alsoThe only reason for which I recommend M12 is It comes with Android 11 out of the box and latest One UI also its built quality within 5 months of purchasing there is voice issues in mobile Not able to hear talk from other side suddenly and need to switch off and on mobile frequently after switching on the mobile there wont be any voice issues for couple of hours but again the issue will arise after some time after restarting the device again for some this issue will get resolved Currently restarting the device min for 10 times in a day Wonderful purchase I got it for 9499 Amazing budget phone camera is decent and touch sensitivity is good Battery life is good but it starts to slow down with usageThere is not lagging yet Fingerprint is prompt in action but they need to work on the face unlockIf you have a normal usage with no gaming this phone is for you Its a steal deal The phone is goodBest for daily use but if you will play heavy games you may face problemCamera and built quality is also goodThe main problem is with the deliveryThe phone was broken and when I complained about it they said we can not do anythingNow I am using a broken phone without any of my fault0 Star for AmazonIf you want to buy any product online dont consider Amazon Its very prior to review because I got it one week before But I fully satisfied with Samsung galaxy M12 I am Very Happy for this purchase This was value for money deal for me  Thank you Amazon 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓Thank you Samsung 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓☺💗 Go for this if you want samsung brand and trustDont waste your money on chinese phones samsung nis far better than other brandsAlso In this you will get One UI core version but samsung doing amazing job with its UI and implementationBattery life is awesomeRecommended phone camera quality is very poor and we cannot watch videos in HD1080 quality and upto the mark FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS REALLY GOOD IT READS AND UNLOCKS IN LESS THAN A SECOND AND THE PROCESSOR USED HERE IS AS EQUIVALENT TO SNAPDRAGON 662  660 SOMEWHEREIF YOU ARE PLAYING PUBG IT GIVES HDHIGH SMOOTH  ULTRA OVERALL THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR DAILY USAGE AND GAMING BUT IT HAS A 8MP POOR FRONT CAMERA SENSOR IF YOU DONT USE YOUR CAMERA MUCH THIS PHONE IS FOR YOU  Received the phone on time as promised The battery backup is just fabulous  6000 mAh definitely the power backup requirement that every phone needs Easy to use phone but some apps are pre loaded which can be deleted if not using But definitely way ahead than all the other chinese brands With 6Gb RAM using the phone is as smooth as silk I would recommend this phone with the 6GB  128GB config to others Samsung is really worst companymany time I unable to receive the phone callsI will never buy Samsung phones anymore I dont know why they forcefully added their apps in the phone and you cant remove them I bought this mobile for my mothershe doesnt use much apps  mostly Youtube insta wastapp music  facebookCant comment how this mobile performs for GamesOveral nice looking  robust mobile good processor camera is also good charging last upto 2days normal usage Fingerprint scanner is too slowTouchscreen doesnt respond 510 timesNeed to long press many times to get responseNetwork issueThis is review after using this phone for 5 daysTotally disappointed Bought the Samsung M12 Good purchase Worth the priceLikes1 Exceptional Battery backup2 Fast processing for Game Play3 Good Display clarity4 Very responsive Biometric sensors especially Face RecognitionNot so Good Camera clarity especially during night time in artifical light Also the speaker sound could have been louder I bought the phone the 6GB ram version and have been using it for three days now Tge functions are smooth and the camera and screesize are great for the prize It also gets fully charged in an hour Will review again after a few more days Can accomodate 2 sim cards plus a sd card simultaneously Also the finish as the back is textured and matte not glossy like it seems in the pictures If you expect to use WIFI in 5GHz band at home  then Dont go for it it supports only 24 GHz  Really disappointed after got to know this it was not highlighted specifically in the retail sites info is available in Samsung site onlyYou cant full enjoy an internet speed at home even if you have 5GHz band router It is written thatWhats in the box Handset Ejection Pin Manual Data Cable and Travel AdaptorI received only Mobile Data Cable  Adaptor there is no handset Ejection pin manual warranty card and proper bill Its amazing Its really a monster reloaded versionworks amazingly Even the Amazon service was niceit was not damaged when deliveredI has all new featuresand is very satisfactoryjust how android users need camera is nice toon specially the cover it has gotis very grippythe phn doesnt slip from hands😅 Grt product at this price bank offer also appliedCamera rating 2 starDisplay 2 starBattery  Performance 5 starOver all good product at this price A sturdy phone with good battery and storage for rough and tough use Camera is good with good quality front and back cameras The 65 dimension is very good for viewing videos This at an affordable price makes it a paisa vasool mobile I have bought this phone for my cousin whenever he is editing videos or playing new indian version of pubg phone is getting hang very muchOtherwise phone for normal use is good not good for video editting and game lovers Not much impressed with this product for this price Mobile is very bulky and fingerprint sensor is not much handy Photo quality is just okay when I compare with redmi y3 Everything is very good som people said processor is not good but its absolutely very epic it can handle any task also I didnt use it for gamingoyher than that video editing is great and battery can stand upto 2days if not use very hardly it has a great battery  camera is fabulous also galaxy apps give u boost in every way hence this phone is very fabulous under 10K Hence Proved Camera Quality is great with good processing speed and classy features Only limitation is with the 5 GHz wifi connection It only connects to 24 GHz wifi network sometimes it lags camera quality is very good but not excellent compared to other phones in 2030k range despite it having 4 cameras and battery life is good but for a 6000mah battery it shouldve had more battery life and it lags sometimes when calling and stuff overall a good device for the price got it for 85k on amazon The mobile takes around 4 hours and gets drained out in 23  hours ONLY WiFi enable and NO GPS NO WifCalling NO Hotspot NO Hotspot NO Bluetooth without any usageFurther the Amazon replacement process is too lengthy and bad Youll have to go through a technician home visit in the process M12 build is good Handset is little bit heavy Camera quality is 5050 Battery life is awesome With Android 11 browsing is faster Fingerprint on right side works well Phone is just okay similar to m30 m31s However this phone misses to have dual band wifi Supports only 25 Ghz wifi band limiting the wifi speed Unable to make of 5Ghz wifi for higher speed  good proc not heating much fast good storage not slow after 2 months of usage with a lot of old  transferred data and apps value for money good sound not great but good Sab kuch bhandia hai bs ek chiz samsung ki joh shuru se khrb hai ki thoda sa 2 3 week me 1 bar hang ho jata hi 1 2 sec k lie Baki agar mobile ki bat kre toh thoda bhari v hai or mota v hai ek bar offline chala k dhekh lo fir online khreed lo very poor quality display The new samsung m12 is really amazingHas a side fingerprint reader and battery quality is goodThe product was delivered early with proper careThe display is good and samsung has introduced a few new quirks into the UIVery good phone for the budget Battery  Performance  Long Lasting  But It Takes More Than Two  Half Hour To Complete Charge  So There  Is Nothing Like Fast Charging  think self 15w charger for 6000mah battery Camera Quality Poor As They Call It 48 Megapixel Camera But Actually It Dont Take Proper Zooming Shots more u can guess self And Rest All Features Are Best As My Own Understanding For Such Budget  Real battery monster good RAM  processor performance At this budget getting these 2 key features is a great deal Camera quality may not be satisfactory but overall the phone is great We cannot expect all top features at this price Still the phone is a great product at this price Good value for money Bought it for my parents Screen is large so easy for them to use However Samsung should think of making it lighter Good build quality good camera The touch is awfully unresponsiveYs without any protective glass which fails as a touch device in the first placein these days of loaded cameras this is kind of ok so is the battery Samsung doesnt promise much on display but the bothersome unresponsive touch is a big downfall which overrides everything else about the phone Phone touch is smooth doesnt hang and heat battery life is best and charges fast problem with this phone is camera quality they say its 48mp but it feels like 13mp fingerprint sensor onside is very inconvenient they must have placed it on the back and the phone is very heavy Worst product from Samsung ibreally did not expect this from samsung and I really had more expectations about this productMore over this phone says 90 hz display bit it hangs a lot and its like using a fake 3 class phoneI do not want the other customers to fall for the Advitisment of this device which is a total scam I would like to says people be careful and dont be a victim to this phone Review Summary I bought two Samsung phone and both have below cons A21 Rs 18000 M1210500Dislike Charging Speed too low Camera is very bad Phone is quite slow as compared to other rivalary phone Too heavy In short Phone is very costly as compared to its features Touch screen is also not so fast Sometimes it doesnt workSamsung seriously need to work on the above problems Initially when I purchased I had a problem with its speaker after the instructions followed for fixing now the device is overheating while charging  also when Im using for even small applications like Google meet its not even a heavy application like COD  I advise you to not buy this device it has so many issues like this Worst experience ever and its only been a month since I have purchased it from Amazon The worst mobile I have bought from samsung I have been a premium samsung customer in past where I havent faced any issues But for this model by day 16 the display is not seen and I cant replace the mobile even in Amazon and also in samsung The battery is getting heated up I suggest not to buy this model because I have an issue in camera which I have replaced and faced the above issue with the second buy This phone was gifted by me and the user of the phone has the following complain she is been using it for 15 days now1Sometime the dialing just stops and it hangs for a while2 Sometime u cannot disconnect the call3 In a span of 15 days the phone has hanged for 4 times4 I feel there is a software issue5 there are few small problems while using the phone but cannot explain Battery is pathetic  Its not 6000 mh battery it drains very fast Phone is ok for 10000 budget Samsung quality has dropped  Earlier Samsung phone had a superb qualityPeople buying this phone can go ahead Good phone only battery  draining fastI am using vivo y12 Its 5000 mh battery  but it last more than M12 Samsung offered great features in this price range but the performance is not as it may seem Back camera is good but front camera image quality reminded of starting phone camera blurry Fingerprint reader does not work many times Surprisingly this new phone also hangs sometimes Still it is usable considering its price You can consider MI to Samsung in this price range Good about product battery  is superb camera is Ok Ok not so good as expected from 48MP camera easy to operateNegatives processing is concern  very slow response of touch  even my three years led phone give better touch response hindi typing is tedious process which must be easy like other phones charging time is 3 hours so not so quick Phone is quite heavy in weight Fingerprint sesnsor is fast Camera quality is not as good as expected UI is smooth Back panel looks good Battery is good As the headphone jack is in the lower part of the panel you cant keep the phone in upright position when the headphone is plugged in Loved this phone especially battery life is amazing  I can easily go without charging for 2 days I m not a heavy user though I play CoD once a day and response is good doesnt lag at all Happy with this buy full value for moneyCon Camera could have been better just that I have seen better photos with lesser specs Not bad for my needs as Im not a PUBG fanboy good for elderly people go for Galaxy F22G80 or M212021Exy9611 if youre looking for a better gaming XP Camera suffers in low light but pretty solid in daylight Software is well optimised unlike Mi and Realme Quite a bit overpricedNot Bad but certainly not the Best Galaxy F22 has better XP M03s has better Value Interior product with very bad quality body material Not charging and battery is getting heatingVery much unsatisfied with Amazon to list such a bad quality product selling no support being provided after sellAlso I loosed trust on Samsung Hard to believe such big brand reputed company ditching customer by providing worst quality product I bought this for my mother who uses for basic calls and youtube Not for moderate or heavy users It will be a good option if calls and little bit of social media are the only things you use on phone Purchased the device 2 months back Now Mobile Display was not showing and when shown to the service center they wont cover the display under warrenty they charged us for the displayDevice display causing the issue because of high capacity battery and mobile heating issue This is an amazing product the ram is really fast and its battery life is just amazing I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this The cameras are amazing and Im super happy with the front camera as well The scrolling feels so smooth and the wide screen is a good feature  Overall Im really happy with this definitely an upgrade from my old Redmi Note 4 I used this mobile ofter 1 week iam giving reviewFinger print sensor is above 3 starScreen is above 3 starCharging and battery is welldone 5 starCamera is just ok above 2 starMobile  working just fine like 4 gb ram its not working like 6 gbAnd I will say finally go for another mobile it is only 4g mobile Even 5g wifi is not connect this mobile genaration is going fast Phone seems looks good but getting stuck when we browsing while using calls and using camera So I recommend do not choose samsung at all Go for better company where reasonable prices applicable ✅ Solid build quality from Samsung as always Feels bit premium due to the textured and smudge proof back panel✅ Amazing display 4k 60fps 90Hz✅ Responsive side fingerprint sensor✅ Average camera but good in budget✅ Made in SAMSUNG Noida Plant INDIA Dont have to worry about giving your hard earned money to CCP controlled companies Product supplied was having damage Images and videos arr not having clarity as them appeared to be blurred like negative film of old photograpphy Black surface is appeared to be white and white appeared to be black Even the images and videos downloaded from internet are found to be not visible and having no clarity Also the photos taken in photone are having no visibility So i placed return request Not satisfiedas told in products reviews told at The time of saleNot a Fast changing as mentioned Got heated while charging product value questions your brand Samsung M12 series Even not listed in your own brand list for exchange options why it so Camera is the best of all without a doubt Device is very smooth and it can be used 2 days or more if you dont use heavilyI am a heavy user with lots of phone calls and heavy using of youtube Phone is heavy because of its massive 6000 mah battery Every thing is fine if you dont play heavy games we can play games under 400mb smoothlySmooth device writing this after 2 months of usage loving it 🔥😍 Writing this review after 23 months of using it Phone is sturdy  battery life is superbFinger print sensor  Face recognition needs improvement Sound is excellentCamera is as per the best quality Camera quality is not as expected  we can consider a low budget phone Finger print reader doesnt works some times Battery backup is great built quality is nice I have been facing issue of wifi connectivity post software

heating no hanging no slacking Fast browsing sound is good  Handling  very easy batter back up very  high finger print reader stylish  nice camera quality  good Never been a fan of Side finger print so no points here Battery life is definitely good Camera and sound are both just average nothing more Im sure had i broadened my horizon there are better products to choose from in this price range Samsung M12 mobile is excellent for low budget Camera Battery Backup Display  Sound quality is too much good So I recommend to all viewers go  purchase this mobile without any doubt  hesitation Thanks  Samsung to bring this product for middle class peoples My choice is all to use Samsung because its operating system is very easy to any userRegardsKhilaban Kumar Das The mobile lacks in some of the basic features Screen capture is a problem and other gunctionalities You cant set a clock as screen saver I feel the basic features that doesnt involve costs should be made available Samsung is providing better phone now but this m12 is less than average Average display average battery and charging U can buy it for your father or mother means who dont use it more would love to buy it Bought it as my talking device because of its huge battery capacity It is a secondary device and I love it If you’re looking for a simple device at best price I would surely recommend it Very good phone with a nice battery The camera quality is up to the mark According to the price The fingerprint sensor also works very Smoothly The display is also good but you cant really find the difference from 60hz to 90hz Although the phone is good for its price but in the box you  dont get a cover pre applied screen protector and a short USB cable Awesome mobile in this price segment Battery is big for 1 12 day Rear camera is also good In this range 8nm processor  with thebrand of Samsung Ossummm after 3 months of use this product i recommend u all that buy it if u want mobile phone in this range network speed is also bestest because of 8nm processor all the best Camera quality is below par than the 12MP old phones Poor Customer service No call recórding option No ultra power saving mode Never buy Samsung phones its last its quality Attached photos for reference Samsung blaming Amazon saying they provided the defect piece to me Efficient authorised service provider finding is also headache in this pandemic situation BETTER NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT No any help option on Amazon for warranty replacement display If 6 month screen replacement warranty from amazon side so how is the processbcz no any replacement optionno any contect number amazon customer care for helpvery bad service6 month warranty only provide from amazonno warranty from samsungsamsung service center told give me 3600 RS for  display replacement charges So what I do I got the product seems used by some one there are finger print in the mobile phone screen also the bill found in two piece already tored by someone The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good packaging delivery and excellent phone The phone has a very good battery life and the camera is very good and takes excellent photos Its a decent phone very fit for this price range Its worth buying worth the price Taught this phone is really very good and purchased face tec issue net work was not at  all capturing completely phone was very sloe compare to my previous one Tec guy visited finally noting happned because phone had issue and got a replacement for new 1but was surprised beacuse the second 1is worster then before Am really very upset almost 2weeks without a a phone is not at all acceptable Very good purchaseExcellent battery life better than Galaxy 31s modelAll the features are good except cameraVery happy with the purchase of this phone Perfect value phone Has everything that one requires For the price it is more than value It is a little heavy compares to others but not a deal breaker perfect for gifting to parents There is a software problem whenever you make a call for the 1st time the speaker is not activated and so you cant hear anything the person on the other side is speaking But if you disconnect it and call again it works fine Initially i thought its network issue but later i realised it happens every time i try to make i call after a considerable time gap like an hour or so I got this for 11499 which was a great deal for 6gb ram and 128 gb memory Phone camera is not worth the quality mentioned and the device is also having more weight Rethink if you want to buy this Not sure why amazon removed return policy its better to check phone locally in shop and buy I dont use mobile for heavyduty stuffFrom my regular use for a month now I can tell that there have been No hangs Hence a great improvement over my previous phone back is nonslippery and hence fewer chances of mobile damage pretty good for clumsy guy like me Wonderful phone for the provided price This was bought for my father I was using one plus 7 pro and due to repair I was forced to use this phone for a week and to be honest other than camera I was more than satisfied with this mobile and its performance Camera quality is not at par Samsung also doing as china Shown 48 megapixel camera but infact it may lower than 5 megapixel onlySamsung have to do something Very wrost experience this timeTouch is not working sometimegeasture is not working sometimecamara taking too much time to saving image after taking picturemic problem when you make video call Phone auto restarts at times touch capabilities are not that great everything you have to ensure that your hands are completely dry Even with a minute moisture on your fingers phone gives you improper response Speed is OK for working since it is 6 GB RAM Battery is very good Display is  also OK For doing normal data processing work lime share trading for using excel Word small types of editing   this system is enough but if you intend shooting  its not enough  Camera is not seems 48 MP Front camera is OK Its amazing product from samsungi congrats to Samsung engineer but one mild issues affect this mobile heat issue at the same it is not continue otherwise only charging time it might be heat slightlyVery low budgetCamera okTouch okModel okUsing very comfortableBattery heating is slightly negative so I give four 🌟 and with out battery issue I give 5 🌟 Most disappointing thing is its camera qualityIts 48mp camalera is not worthy It does not match with Nokias 13 MP cameraI purchase it for camera purpose but it does not fulfill my requirement Camera quality is very poorThough display is quite decent battery life is normal functioning is smoothIf you are looking a mobile phone for camera then never buy it Samsung really needs to stop fooling customers with its marketing and needs to improve its products to compete other brands This new samsung m12 is a piece of crap and wastage of money The sound is too low If the phone is ringing you cant hear even if you are sitting next to it The design is okay No new or nothing very impressive Copied the F12 in terms of design screen broken amazon claims that there is one time free screen replacement warrantee for Prime i am not able to claim warrantee product support section of amazon is not working  PointsGood Budget PhoneGood DisplayGood Outlook PointsToo heavy due to big batteryThe camera is not that effectiveTakes longer to charge Fingerprint senser is not so sensitive One has to put hisher finger very tightlyBattery charges slow since it supports 15 watt charger It drains faster if adaptive motion is set to 90 hzCamera quality is decent but it should be improved In 48 mp mode flash will not workIts backlight remains always on due to which processor is heatedSpeakers are very slow After gaining experience by using it at least 3 months then correct answer will come How can I give 5 out of 5 within a month Thanks for your cooperation I already have one Samsung M20 After buying this new M12 I installed Samsung smart switch on both phones It  transferred all data except messages in thousands I raised request with Samsung They clarified it is software bug and update would be provided within 24 Hrs Its third day no update is received I am returning new M12 phone Like the Samsung brand experience but its motherboard failure within 2 months disappointed Battery life is good lasting for 2 full days More bulky n weight Brought this mobile on March 30 I am not satisfied with this mobile Its getting heat when we use it for the normal phone calls without internet as well When i checked with Samsung service center they said that if the mobile heat goes beyond 48°C then they can look into it Not sure who will be able to withstand this mobile heat when they are talking Pls dont buy I am using this product since last 1 month The display is nice HD display but colour contrast is amazing The battery last upto 36 hours with normal useCamera is good for captureing pictures day light Its 90hz disply is awsomeThis smartphone is NOT FOR GAMINGThere is slight lag while using heavy appsOtherwise its a good budget phone 👍👍 I am the user  of only Samsung  Compared to other models that I have been using till date  this model doesnt satisfy me The signal strength is low compared to other brands in this price and specificationsOverall I am not satisfied with this model seems a seconds phone like factory reject or a repaired version like refurbished maybeits bentthe screen cant be covered with tempered glass as the phone is curved a good phone at this costfingerprint and face lock works perfectly finecamera is also good in this costdo not expect stabilitythere is no lag while usingThe best part is battery if you are not a heavy end user then you even need not see the battery for even 2 days once it is fully chargedthe worst part is display very poor visibility in daylight The phone built quality seems good The weight is a little more than expected Battery life and camara is good Latest version of Android is also provided Better finger print reader was expected Bigger size scanner on back would be better New fingerprint reader is awesome with nice ergonomics Battery life no complains because of bed processor technology Camera quality is ok ok at this price Totally unsatisfied with the PLS TFT display and heavyweightPLS TFT screen is low quality couldnt enjoy video steaming If you are in habit of watching a movie and playing gaming then you can search for other better mobileNow both Amazon and Samsung refused to accept return or provide me replacement of better quality display ie Amoled IPS Display Obviously battery is 6000 maH the phone is very heavy and feels like a brick in handThe battery life is not that great but satisfied as a non gaming phoneDont buy this if you are looking for a phone with good performance during playing games This phone is good only for daily use and you can gift your parents or elders who are not into gaming or desire high performance Worst samsung phne ever Its heavy display is so not smooth have to like press each button atleast thrice Cant ans calls on time as it kips hangin Its not even a month since i purchased  Camera is average After using the phone for 45 days it looks good to use with low refresh rate and good battery backup decent camera  Phone little bit heavy due to heavy battery and Wifi 5g band wont support in this phoneAlso can use dual 4g sim at a time Dont buy this phone it has some technical issues The phone is best buy in terms of pricing and features I guess this is the best option if someone is looking for a good Samsung phone at a proper budget First of all this mobile will not work like 4 GB ram mobile it has touch issue and it hangs very much  even if you do not have any thing in your mobile still it hangs while using youtubedo not purchase blindly by seeing attractive price then you suffer a lot there is no return policy Very nice phone but it very much heavy than compare to other phonesyou cant carry in your pocket while woking If you are field worker I suggest dont buy  This is worst product from Samsung  Under 10k we can move to vivo oppo or redmi brands wisely  Camera quality is very very poor  After taking photo we see broken pixels and the worst picture  48MP true camera is only for mouth speech really it is very worst one  Mobile become heat while charging alone  Very much disappointed  Not worthy for money  Dont buy this product Pathetic phone Battery goodCamera poorPerformance very poor very slowWhen you cut a call than notification of call ended arrivez and stays there for 5 minutes You can not see complete keyboard while using other app Absolutely patheticCharger very very poorScreen poorSound poorOverall below average phone in 10k price Bakwas camera  picture  quality  bohoth hi kharab hai 48mp camera  lagta hi nahi hai aur front camera  toh wahiyaad hai 2mp camera

goodBattery as committed last long camera clarity is okay one of the best I used as per Samsung Charger says its fast charging its fake it takes more than 2 hrs to get 100 charged Fingerprint is not good I struggle everytime Waste product Both amazon and Samsung cheated us Worst camera Mobile is too heating while charging If long time on a call when also mobile get more heating Finally the most worst experience is Amazon did not retake the mobile when we give request for return The return policy is very worst So please no one but this waste mobile The media could not be loaded\\n

phone was fantastic On a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it 9 The thing that I didnt like about this is that it has very less storage Otherwise very good  MUST BUY I am using this phone from two days I have exchanged my redmi 4 with m12 But after two days of usage I found that this phone is not fast as redmi 4 I read reviews and got into dilemma when got mixed reviewsBut according to me its worth a buyAll functions i found good with a good screen sizeThe only con felt was that it was a little heavy for the pocket Thats some competition in the budget phone market the device looks sturdy overall good good display and battery Looks like i dont need a new phone for 34 year anymore Charging point in mobile is not working and as this one is my second mobile I started it bit late and return period is over this one is made in  India Samsung Mobile Battery charging is fast and consumes less power The only drawback is mirroringcasting of videos is not satisfactory  as videos on TV appeared  staggering Impressed by Delivery delivered within 4 days Delivery boy was humble I ordered this phone for my Friend who was using Redmi 4A since 2017 I was worried for its TFT LCD panel as it is not as good as IPS LCD but amazed with its screen quality Screen quality is justified for its price I got it in 85k in Festive offer and brand value and Viewing angles are acceptable Overall ok experience

classy and unique look Overall it is outstanding smartphone in low budget I like this phoneI m using this phone and no issues in this  phoneSome people are saying  hang phoneBut it is no hang and I love It performance Camera quality does not meet the standard as described in features Being 48 mega pixel camera does not click good quality pictures also the colours of camera clicked pics are very dull Front camera is of worst quality I have samsung a50 comparing the camera quality this M12 is dull and poor inspite this being quad camera setup Only this battery life is good And provided the budget cant complain much But still there are many good camera quality smart phones available in this range Advice you all to check in person and then order the device Main cause is lcd screen in this costOther brand give very much better options I had very bad experience with Samsung M12 Why Samsung has made this with lcd Very dissapointed productNot value for MoneyIf it is for rs8000 it is OKOnly positive feedback is Battery backupCamera Not good front and rearFinger print Not comfirtableNO default call recording optionIf you having tru call then we can recordLittle more weght compared to other smart phone And having hang for some times one main lacking of samsung is not using the lens manufactured by SONY carl zeiss Phone is great  Great display quality rich colors smooth display interfaceCamera quality was not up to markGreat budget phone for normal user 👍👍👍 In photo looks so slip but its fat and dose not looks good  And the display quality is just hd that i just seen every pixels  Dont go for this  Finger print reader is moderate Battery life is good Rear Camera doesnt look like 48mp This phone is a budget  phone  which  will help with long 1 and half day  battery life with always full brightness location and data on   Camera is  good  on pro mode  but cannot  be compared  with  high  pixel phones  6 GB ram is enough  for play  games This phone has enough  fps for games like  pubg asphalt  games  no lag This phone is not original camera quality is very poor its written 48Mp but even the picture quality is less than 10MP always heating and very slow Then we registered the complaint service appointment was yesterdy no one came for service and also we received Mail service is done Very very bad service and we dont know where should contact Camera quality is blur and sometimes this phone hang without any reason I dont know why this phone hang when RAM is 6 gb and 8 nano meter processorDisplay quality is also not up to mark as we see in samsung phones what you are giving in this phone samsung if dont have buget for this type  phone they why you promoting mid buget phones Weight is heavy other than that it is worth the money  but since battery is big and works very long it is heavy  Little slow at opening the apps sometimes apps lag but i hope it will work for long time  You dont need to worry about charging the phone often once fully charged even if used continuously it stands for one day The stuff is too good and its working so well Its fingerprint senser is so good specially the camera bit there is one problem I dislike about it that its battery backup is so poor and the battery Neel down so fast and also one thing there is limited fonts in this device for using it freelybut all over this device so good and I appreciate this product SAMSUNG GALAXY M12 is not responding properly 1 Suddenly switch off while on call 2 Most of the times ring tone will not come 3 During transactions the numbers in the key pad appear only half

speed Hi quality camera  speakers latest features All the features are good v nice camera value for money but the only problem is that the phone is little heavy and after putting a back cover it becomes more heavy rest its superb product from samsung 👌👍 As we know Samsung is a leading worth brand I bought this mobile 2 months before Up to today it is working well Cemera accessiblty should be improve Un necessary apps and ads showing But quality is good ProsGood battery backupGood quality cameraFast response of finger printConsLittle bit bulkyPhone take few second after restartSome time

camera Battery performance too good Dolby Atmos sound feature is tha main point Feel like theatre Speacially Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds Pro comparable i have earbudsGuys please go on this phone Amaizing phone This phone is reasonably good for the reason that price tag and features are incomparable at all Excellent finger print reader that pushes the gadget to the nexgen range As a lay user I can say that the camera is not that impressive as the one expects in 48MP camera The processor is also just fine if not awesome Am writing this review after 2 yrs of usage  Daily usage  2 hrs  soft handling I updated to latest andriod update  After that mobile not getting swicthed on  Only samsung logo is appearing V worst experience  Checked with help center they told will charge 6k but no warranty Thrown away to e waste  Overall great phone battery drain problem issue found speaker output quality not good I replace it on the first time but I didnt meet the quality of sound in the bass and picture quality not too good I suggest those who want purchase this phone kindly think many times before purchasing this phone Picture quality is not HD only written is HD poor quality Great India festival is just to fool us and get benefit for Amazon my product received with defect piececustomer care executives and leadership guy guy we can not give replacement buy for now extra moneyI took in in offer for less price got defect piece they say now to take me for higher price Excellent phone with reasonable price tag and with the assured service of Samsung Camera quality is quite good compared to redmi Chinese products Battery Life is awesome with fastest 80nm processor Display is good but i was expecting fhd display but current quality is also good with 90hz display overall it is midrange phone and i satisfied with the phone Faulty product delivered to me worst experience mobile battery is no charging and having problem with connector Picture quality also blurred in between watching videos I have m31 mobile as well and try same charger too facing same issue Product purchased just 3 months back I need immediate refund or replacement of this product Excellent phone in this range with good battery only thing of concern is its finger print reader location many times login error appears due to different finger or hand location getting accidently touched to finger print reader which is a bit annoying Dont buy this product bad  camera quality only battery back good I have use this product and i am sharing the feedback  So please dont buy go to some where else  likeVivo and Redmi Its a really very nice phone and good working also camera quality Good and battery backup too good 👍I liked product Dislike This phone could not able to find network  all time it goes to offline with the good network when we compare with other phonesI recommend to my friend also so it has the same problemThis phone is launched by Amazon only for their customersFrom this we conclude whatever the company failure products are available in Amazon selling Hai mobile is very bad every time heating at the time charging the time heating problem the mobile is worst mobile and Amazon customer very very very very worst customer and told there is no responsibilities in Amazon customer so many time I was calling Amazon customer but there is no response at Amazon customer A little bulky in size and weightBattery life is amazing i charge once in 2 days inspite of being on calls most of the dayFinger print is very quick n sensitive But wrongly placed Mostly it gets touched while taking out of the pocket n it says 5 incorrect finger prints and locks the mobile Phone look like a ugly Its shown 4 rear camera  and upto 48mp but worst that 5mp  Even a Chinese mobiles under 3000 value gives better  photos than this phone Really  disappointed Samsung is good brand  I like this phone so very much it has perfect camera quality no hang issue good sound quality and perfect in size and shape  Fully satisfied according to price Thanx Samsung for giving such a wonderful phone in reasonable cost never buy this Samsung below 17k mobiles all the worst mobiles they wont function at all in all angles and more over battery 🔋 the worst experience Actually I bought this mobile for my mom and she said that she is having a wonderful experience in using the mobileTo keep it simple go for it Bought it for my mom as her note 5 pro was broken This one is really good and shes absolutely happy with the phone this is the best phone I have ever used dont listen to rumors about M12 everything display quality  touch response quick biometric best camera true 48 mp charged in just 25 hrs completely decent sound quality go for it Battery is goodCamera is not good Zoom the images or a pic taken using zoom and all details are lost Hoping Samsung release some update to improve it It has preinstalled and unwanted apps so usable memory is less than expected May be Samsung can keep these on cloud rather than phone and leave a choice to the user Phone performance is good for daily uses Battery performance is good enough for a dayi like fingerprint sensor is fast n simple to use Im disappointed with the given camera quality Phone heating issues comes when used continuously with normal function and playing gamesfast is not that fast But I like this Phone at this price range The screen is too fragile My 5 year old accidentally dropped it twice Both times the display shattered This occurred within 2 months of use The phones heavy to hold due to the big 6000 mAh battery but still the battery life is not upto the mark Thats disappointing The fingerprint reader is fast and good The camera quality is average Overall the phone is average for the cost And samsung is still the same 100GB RAM is also too low for their mobile phone Its a beast at 9999 with ICCCI bank discount 6000 mah battery with 24h backup Ways camera which clicks beautiful pictures TFT screen  cant expect more with this price Performance is good And the best is the finger print sensor its ultra first and the fingerprint on the power button makes the phone more beautiful I have purchased this product almost a month ago the product was defective since the voice of both side person was not audible Hence I raised the request to return or replacement but till now nobody is arrived to my place If you are not taking action on this I need see for the further action to be taken Have used the phone for a month Works very well so far no obvious issues Havent tried some features eg fingerprint reader dual Sim Its great that it utilizes Android 11  the most recent version although too many apps are preloaded Cameravideo recorder works well Good product in this category Exceeded my expectations The Samsung Galaxy M12 is a Battery monsteras advertised it will last a lot longer than the typical smartphone and its worth the money spent on it my only problem is the 720p display samsung could have gone with a 1080p oled but the display here is not horrible the image quality is quite good actually and One UI 31 is awesome The newly lahnched phone is packed with everything that can come blow 13k inr The camera The battery and The design of The phone is perfect in every manner I recommend this product if someone wants a good smartphone under 15k safety deliveryexchange offer very goodtime of exchange within minutephone price also very reasonable Not worth at all Neither processor nor camera is good Camera is so poor at this price range better to look other option than this Also the phone is super heavy Low in signal whether it is network signal or wifi networkLagging alot because of samsung processorVery disappointed Best phone at this price range Amazing battery life only con is selfie camera is not up to the  mark according to MP level Good mobile i buy this for my grandmaa she is happy 😊 battery backup is great and screen quality is quite impressive fingerprint is fast but camera is not like Samsung even j7 have good quality camera if we compare from this 48 mp is blunder  quality is like 5  8 mp Lovely product Great finishing Loved camera quality  Good mid range mobile at steal away price Didnt find finger print reader comfortable May be I am used to back side finger print reader 5000 mah better runs good Would have loved if it was 6000 mah Newest and cool system for fingerprint monster battery  charge is staying for 2 days al leastsleek designfast processor camera good Audio quality not good cant hear voice loud and clear on call If planning to buy this for parents dont buy instead go for m21 if need a samsung phone only Please dont buy it Its been hardly a month since I bought this phone and it has hung already The camera quality is not cool the refresh rate is not at all good and most importantly the battery capacity is not as good as promised This phone is just another scam dont buy this Dont be fooled Small budget but great quality in processor and batter life Camera quality is not great but for the given budget it is ok Heavier than m31 Bigger than m31 and better battery life than m31 Processor speed wise i feel same as m31 So if you are not much focused on camera then this is best budget phone My main purpose was using phone for calls and what app But after getting this product I started using games started taking selfies and main thing started watching movies with HD quality watching 2 movies per day with HD and still having battery life of 75 Its awesome Fingerprint was quite good accommodated in power button Selfie camera is not good But product design and performance not bad under this price section is good Sound quality is quite good Not recommend for heavy gamer There is no FHD Got it for 95k and good phone hangs a bit but ok for daily use Sad and Pathetic display also feels like camelin geometry box in your hand everything is slow abt this phone u can have a tough tine woth the pjoje display  i wonder if these celebrities are using this phone p Poor display color contrast in this cellphone was very low  I dont know it is particular my handset issue or something else I had some urgency thats why I was unable to replace that cellphone But my advice is dont buy this one Their offers are just a scam to sell their poor products Never buy this mobile to take indoor photos as it has a very poor quality camera You cant find yourself in photos if you took photo at night It would be a total waste of money if it doesnt have long battery life yeh mobile lene ke baad mein chootiyan ban gayaamazon customer wale ne muhje phir bhi chootiyan bana rahe hei Nice phone I have been using this phone for last 1months According to me The best part of this mobile is the battery 🔋 Thank you  Very heavy weight Average camera very short usb cable Also did not get headphones with the package Not that good for this price I havent expected a better phone in this price range Along with the brand name of Samsung you are getting great camera great screen great battery backup and 2ghz quad core processorIts a great but until now This phone is not up to mark like other Samsung mobile It doesnt have dual band WiFi connection It doesnt have 5Ghz WiFi receiver It only has 2Ghz WiFi receiver So you will get lesser speed when connected to 2ghz इस फोन में बहुत सारे प्रॉब्लम है चार्ज में लगाने के बाद फोन ऑटो ऑफ हो जाता है फिर उसे ऑन करने में घंटों लग जाते हैं मैं किसी को राय नहीं दूंगा कि इस फोन को परचेज करें और आप कभी भी आर्डर करें आपको सेकंड हैंड मोबाइल ही दिया जाएगा डिस्प्ले में डॉट रहता है बाकी बहुत सारे मल्टीपल प्रॉब्लम है फाइनली यह फोन नहीं लेना चाहिए Finger print reader on right side integrated with power button Difficult to use the left hand fingers for reading the prints I bought this phone for my mother and am happy with the purchase It is pretty easy to use for anybody in ones household The storage space  and overall speed and performance of the phone is also great Everything with the phone is super nice apart from a couple of things finger reader lags for 23 sec before response  Google Maps keep on flickering while on navigation mode Received in damaged condition while calling display gone blank and I need to restart after every call to get display again After using a few days1 For normal user the phone is really Amazing2 Great battery backup with Ctype charger3 Nice camera and very natural

will be a discount but actually there was 0 discount on this mobile It is available on the same price and with zero cost EMI on credit cardIts just a marketing gimmick The phone works fine and all but it is not pleasing to the eye The colours of the screen are extremely desaturated and everything ends up looking dull or like theres a Matte film on the screen Very disappointing Also Amazon will not let me return this product so now I am stuck with it Disappointed in Amazon service as well Recently bought samsung m12 6gb mobile Within one week i am facing issue with phone mic It is not working

storage I must say I got what I was looking for I have purchased this one few days back  so its quite tough to write anything in details But in short I can say first impression is not so bad Display not up to the mark But with dedicated SD slot you can expand memory and also have two SIMs Meets my requirement and quite happy with the product The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0ProsExcellent phone in budget Good camera quality even in night No night mode only tubelight or flash Battery is awesomeConmobile is bulky An average phone with average camera  and feels heavy dont expect too much with quad cameraFrom the first day of usage itself I feel a bit sluggish in every way Camara Quality very worst  like 2MPPerformance is not that much level Quality

quality is very low even with loudspeaker onThis is very bad for this mobileWhen  more than 2 people are connected on whatsapp conference mobile goes on mute and other people cant hear our voice At this price good try by Samsung But some thing missingThis is a average mobile for marketWright now processor should be new like market phone Phone is good but its very heavy just because it has 6000mah battery  phone battery make it lil bit thik which is uncomfortable The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I got this product at 9k after discount  The fingerprint sensor is worst whereas battery and camera are ok The screen function lags sometime but after latest update few of the bugs solved Not so fast as expectedIt’s back camera is higher qualityBut it’s Front camera is very low qualityBuy it for 1 yr next generation 5 GIs coming for better experience Im giving one star bcz it is necessarily too select  star den only  we cn write reviewReally  unhappy  with dis phone 😑🤢😡😡😡🤬Battery  life is not good at allCamera quality is also very poorWhile using  d phone  it get heat upEven while charging  time it heat up i purchased M12 this week 6gb 128 gb i amazed about the battery back up  it has excellent speed while browsing In this price range  no best model avaialble  earlier i have been using A70 which is high end but still M12 is performing same thanks samaung for the wonderful research for this product The battery life is appreciable and also it looks nice just a little heavy   It works smoothly but for some reasons it doesnt feel like 90hz  The camera is average and i expected better but in this price range its not a very big flaw  The usb cable in the box is really short in length  The fingerprint sensor works good Camera quality very good  currently I am attending online classes and at the end of the day Charing is 13  15 left  You can go for it  I am using this model from past 2 months Good product by specs and everything this is the best you can get in terms of battery life speed and camera Only one con is that for 6000 mAH battery it feels a bit bulky but you will get used to it 6 months free replacement offered to prime members is a total fraud Neither Amazon or their partner Savex technologies respond If you want full control of your phone dont buy this one This phone work on its ownit will download many apps which you dont even know without asking you So be aware Overall performance is good but the display resolution is 720p which is the worst part of mobileCamera is OK90hz refresh rate is goodFingerprint sensor is greatEventually I would not recommend to buy this mobile if you are not samsung loverIn this price range there are other good option too Not such a bad product with in this budget it will perform a heavy1camera wise its ok dont expect much2battery life superb no doubt3finger print is quite difficult to use my suggest is to place it on back then it will be

low quality M12 has very worst lcd display which is not even good for the eyescamera quality is worstvideo quality is not so goodGenerally if you are thinking that product has many features then you

product but before delivery but no option to return and process refund even customer service also bad because I paid online I have to product even though I didnt like really disappointed 😞 Good budget phone for normal user Great battery life General samsung performanceUsed for 2 months If your bugets fits will recommend this phoneNot for Gamers  Go away gamers from this device Product was bought without physically checking it I preferred Samsung over Chinese phone but their phone design is far better than Samsung in same budget Screen is too big to hear any call speakers are very bad overall design is not very good heavy to handle Decent phone with good battery back up more than 1 day with good usage Design is good to hold in hand Screen is good Touch is good Camera is ok types with

phone is great at the price range of under11k  This phone has good camera battery is awesome and the 90 hz display is great but the pros in this phone is it does not have gyroscopic sensor which is to be their at this price range also at this price range they should provide us a good display Camera and battery is ok but speed of processor in not satisfactoryAfter a month use of mobile touch screen

camera quality and on the top of it SAMSUNG brand value Bought this mobile a month back Just using for callls and not even download any apps But with in a month its started hanging and touch also has the problem it automatically gets touched in multiples places and reacts wildlyAmazon not providing option for replacement Phone specifications are good Latest version of software pls good camera

48mpBattery  is OKDisplay not expected  clarity Most of it is good except the speaker Even at full vol setting sound is inadequate even in comparison  with other samsung phones such as M10 Very bad product faulty peiceBad Voice is not proper at all der is default in piece plzzz recheck and take or Return the cellohone not clear mic This phone can be used just for talking purpose No fingerprint reader option in this mobile camera quality is not good its very average battery is ok and it exist for one day Mobile is too weight and feels pain if hold for few minutes totally average phone Front camera is not clear shoot any picture I think improve front cameras through Samsung m12 And also back cameras average Good pictures take by m12Battery life is very goodFinger lock is also good not v goodAnd mobile looking is  very good and pretty Just a word dont buy any products of Samsung because once it got default you have to pay for that Samsung service centre wont get it correct under warranty  Please dont buy Little weighty compare to other market leading handsets And sometimes it hangs if you gaming But overall it is good for daily use mobile in budget price Finger print reader is goodbattery life is excellentand camera is averageBut the delivery boy is not good and sincere he is delivered the package without calling me and he is handover the package the other guy without my permission this not so good for Amazons reputation I have bought M12 mobile on Apr2021 and the cost of Rs90000 It was working good and when you playing the games got struck up So Im strongly not recommended for game players Good performance from last 10daysthe day I bought it classy look and better performance with multitasking and multiple profiles As I have official and personal Apps profile configured on to it Works amazingly on both Too heavy for a person to hold it in a pocket and it’s thickness is also more Over all a bulky good phone at its 1011k price after using for month feel it is value for money  battery stays charged for days  better would be more powerful charge it takes bit of time to charge battery Around 10000 ho for it until better arrives Not for gaming For normal people the phone is best I like  all  only  display  build  quality  is  low  no  gorrila  glassprotection I  drop  only  one time  and  it  will  crack  accidently  Over all the Phone is fine The worst part is the Camera 48 MP is a joke the photos are pixelated Shoot in broad daylight its looks fine but zoom in and its pretty bad Samsung I hope will come up with an update to make the camera really worth it Phone is heavy Camera quality is not upto the mark when compared with redmi note 9 and other phones in same categoryDisplay is just averageSpeed is good Remaining all the features are good Charger not working within a month of purchaseThe mobile is very good for its priceThe fingerprint  face recognition is not upto markCamera  battery are good Fingerprint  sensor is very bad camera quality is worst battery life is not performing like a 6000 mah Phone started hanging from the day 2nd Build is good Any phone of Xiaomi even lower than this price will be performing much more better than this phone Delay in Screen responseNo compass app runs as basic requirement of compass app doesnt meetFront camera resolution is lowPhone gangs some timeWont recommend at this price Although it says 48 MP camera it just clicks  like a VGA shots or 5MP shots in a broad daylight Dont know why with triple camera lense they give such poor quality Battery life is good The display of the mobile is so poor that even a 70008000 range cheap mobile has much better display than this mobile The charging rate is so slow that it takes around 3 hours to charge the battery fully It ruined the joy of buying a new mobile  extremely disappointed The Sumsung Mobile which I purchased from Amazon is very poor quality  getting hung  facing  so many timesToday I cant call alsoBefore that I want to return or replace this one But nobody attends meI am a prime member  purchase so many goods So you people solve this problem Battery is good lasts for 1day after continue net brwosingFingerprint is good as expectedCamera quality quite best Camera quality I am wondering why there are claiming 48MP Previously I used Samsung j7 max 16mp that can take better picturesBattery GoodProcessor Good for normal usageFingerprint sensor so GoodOverall good budget phone for normal usage A great Deal for its price Doesnt feel any lag screen feels fluidOnly Con is its camera which is still great for its price but not on par with midrangers With new replacement phone is very good and fast Multi tasksing also more good Battery life is awesome On the whole best phone at this budget The product started lagging since day 1Asked Amazon for replacement and they assures to send a engineer for inspection The person never came and my inspection was marked resolved It was a huge shame as I had gifted this to my Mom Battery life is very good But its fast charger is slower than Redmi Note 5 pro normal chargerCamera quality is also good in this price range I have purchased this mobile for my childs online classes My child is fully satisfied with its performance Phone is good with good batter back up good finger Print sense good speed for gaming as well as for other activitiesOnly drawback is poor display and  poor picture  photos quality Ill not recommend this for Photo Lovers as quality of picture  photos are bad I am little bit worried about this product it is 6000mAH battery but the charge exhausted within 24 hours Second charger is 15w fast charger but it takes almost 2hours 20 minutes for full charging Third Camera quality is not like 48mp I am not fully satisfied with this product This is a good budget phone 6GB Ram is a plus point here Display is decent 90 Hz makes a difference while scrolling and feels smooth Loaded with good Samsung features Rear

very good overall performance is good Display resolution is also very good The qualities which gives this device an edge then other smartphones with same price is its – Battery life 6000 mAh thats huge also with quick recharge  quad camera with 48MP camera and 6GB RAM AND 128GB ROM which is way better than other smartphones with the same price Speaker is not functioning properlywhen call is put on speaker terrible humming sound no clarity in sound Cannot play audio song because of humming soundpurchased  received this new mobile on 2nd Nov 2021Request to replacement of mobile There is no 18 fast charging as mentioned above and battery life also worsewithout net I will stay 1 and half daysUSB cable not working properly while any think needs to be transfer from PC there have not showing USB setting as other samsung mobile showing mode of USB So far its very good  The performance speed and lasting can be checked after one year Camera is average battery life very good processor is little bit slow as other brands display is good  but not too good Disappointed as the camera quality was not at all like 48 mp Plus a lot of pre installed app which cant be uninstalled by user Screen glass quality is not good within ten days after purchasing this mobile phone it slipped from table and fell down screen was damaged and theres no warranty for screen replacementcustomer care is asking 3600 for replacing screen please improve your screen glass quality Phone performance is overall good but camera is of no use Dont buy it if you want to capture photo memories Overall performance is good but camera quality is not up to the mark and can be enhanced little more Sometimes WiFi calling makes it difficult to call and it shows out of coverage so its advisable not to use WiFi calling Overall performance is nice I have been buying only Samsung phone and purchase of this particular model made me to look for alternative in future The display looks very dull even after adjusting brightness I mean the typical  Samsung clarity is somehow missing in this particular model Good phone and camera There is no finger print sensor other than that it awesome phone Excellent Mobile Only for one UI and samsung brandUseless DisplayBasic performanceLow camera qualityGood battery lifeGood sound in earphones Bluetooth devices Pros Battery life compact processor speedCons Network connectivity frequent error shows Network not registered  Camera quality is bad in night modeBluetooth connectivity taking time camera resolution is not goodIt says 48 megapixel but dosent behave like thatsharpness and clarity missingDisplay is fineOverall ok for given price point Camera is niceBattery quality is awesomeSystem UI is goodRAM is just nice6 month after use  it hangs alot even if we have 4 5 extra app on phone Charger is worst company saying fast charger provided with mobile kit but it is totally bluff It is taking 2 nd half hours for full charge So company to provide fast charger or pay compensation immediately to avoid this grievances from customers The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0At this price fingerprint reader battery life and camera quality are very good However as because it is a LCD based display  display quality is not that great Again considering the cost it is good 90hz refresh rate is not experienced The battery life on this phone is very good and the fingerprint reader being on the lock button is handy tooThe camera shutter speed along with the speed on focusing is not the fastest but can be overlooked if camera specs is not a focused topic while buying the phone The product is third class it doesnt capture photo after focusing camera focus is wrost and images are also not good as I was expecting Im literally not at all happy with this Samsung mobile It also doesnt have gyroscope sensor you cant play PUBG in gyroscope mode I like its Battery performance and overall build up quality Camera performance is also better Frankly speaking I could not find any reason in last one month to dislike itThough its a heavier but it is wellknown for 6K mAH battery Didnt like the camera for the price paid in this price or less than that we can buy redmi 7 or any others which gives more better camera quality it has 3camera but useless of having 3 camera Camera quality is like a local phone camera Overall experience for using this phone is good as under this budget you received nice phone with massive battery backup though camera quality is not up to Mark which I believe but overall phone is good you can buy it 1 Good quality in this price2 Everything is monster and its great3 It hangs many times even when I dont have any data4 Its really heavy to use5 Face and fingerprint reader are slow Very disappointed the voice calling features was terribleearpiece is very bad I was not able to hear the other person voice by putting phone in loudspeaker and when I exchange phone the problem was the other person on phone was not able to hear my voice Front camera is poorBattery life is good for average usageFinger print  i wont say slow but not that fast tht issues i guess is with all samsung devices the major issue is with network reception you cant hear the other person on the call clearly Too much heat and mic having issues our voice not clear to others my suggestion go ro redmi 9 power i purchased both that is better than this other this go for any one better I purchased it from 2 months ago from my savings for a good phone but its to bad and worst Mobile I suggest no body to purchased it mobile phone display was automatically off it  and phones is on display quality is worst and know service center was refused to change my phone The audio speaker is not working since beginning Didnt notice since was using headphones most of the times Purchase Date 2nd April  Its impossible to take calls without headphone or loudspeaker as the audio output slot is not functional at all Samsung please help Camera is good90 HZ refresh rate Smooth performanceScreen quality is goodBattery backup is greatOverall Good Smart phone The camera is not good I have Redmi note 7 pro which is also 48mp but has a batter cameraThe phone is very huge it is very heavy and fatIt should be slimI didnt liked it at all I am really impressed with the speaker sound quality and voice clarity during calls The camera is also good although I have not had a chance to use it much as there is not lot of going out nowadays Superb excellent deliveryNo damageAll over agin good and excellent100 originale product This phone is better than Chinese phone in the budget No blotwareno hang time to time updates camera is up to average battery life reliable side finger sensor working good and all features are

Good one from SamsungGood work by Amazon too for quick delivery  The phone got switched off on the 3rd day of purchase Amazon service had come for Mobile inspection but did not anything after that The phone is not working and Amazon has not provided any response about that  Kindly return or exchange the phone 2nd day my handset dead it’s not working I don’t hav word to say I m been scared to buy Samsung’s  cellphone nowI m sorry to say Samsung Display quality is not good Samsung s secure not working Battery is good Camera is good at this price No gorilla glass protection Always on display not available Like Awesome mobile with this cost The phone started lagging just after 1 month I dont have too much apps and I never installed high ram consuming games like PUBG FreeFire etc still the performance is very poorI am unable to pick the calls the screen freezesPathetic Nice phone to buy with loaded features But Battery is 6000mah but seems its gets exhaust in a day and phone width is bit wide Other all features are good and work fast like finger and face unlock Product is good for price range Battery backup is good Battery running up to 15 days with moderate use But phone is having good amount of weight because of large Battery Camera is satisfactory  Display is good Finger sensor good Almost all features are good but call volume is very low this is really necessary hope samsung will fix this in next upcoming versions this one works well at this price point instead of its camera camera is like we are using a 34k range cam worst picture quality bhai thoda bahut toh awkat mein rakho iskoMI 1s aaya tha MI Ka 1st phone 6000 mein uska front cam bhi iske back cam se achcha tha Pros  big battery big displayCons no net speed meter no 3 finger screenshot not clean uv many useless samsung app u dont uninstall it if u using screen guard n back cover your phone is like power bank thickness if u want camera then this phone is not for u Battery life is very good At one charge it can run for 2 days Fingerprint reader is good and fast which is builtin power button and this thing is really impressive and also camera quality is good with quad camera So at this price point of view the phone is awesome The phone performance battery life and camera quality is good But this phone is little heavy to carry and big in size So feel little hard to fit into pocket Awesome productBest feature of this phone is it 90hzTill now no cons visible Love this phone For the price this is the bestGets the job done for a smartphoneAnd to top it off Killer offers from amazon and excellent service by samsung Like Good battery Awesome display and camera Decent performance No pre installed Chinese apps and its made in India Battery life not good Finger print reader not effective Phone is slower than a 3 GB phone Camera not tested as not needed by me Worthless for money charged 48 mp true cam is a scam even my old nokia sybian phone can capture better photo than this While zooming the photos it is like a water paint and fully pixelated So dnt buy if camera is your preference Good product with good battery lifei bought this for my brother in nov21camera is quite low quality but good enough as compare to its price overall its a good product bellow 75k and i am fully satisfied with product Helllo I purchased my new phone Samsung m 12 6 128 on amazon but phone

no issues Hi AmazonWe bought this mobile but seems to be issue with Mobileit is Heating continuouslyIf possible please change our Mobile Worst Product dont buy this cheap quality camera not expected from Samsung feed cheated have been using Samsung phones for 7 years  never buy Samsung phone ever Hanging like every 5 minutes and when I get call sending a template like call you back or pre define messages phone restarting and over heatingnow I realized to exchange but window not allowing me to exchange or return this item kindly guide me Its good at this price its been a week since I have used it high end games work smoothly the battery does not drain or heat up while playing such games the only average quality this phone has is its camera quality It should have been improved with the given price I gifted the cellphone to my mother She is a gaming freak and a gadet freak too I guess its a must buy I have stated using it  I can give an opinion only after using it for some time Good Packing  timely delivery etc is well appreciated thanks  Sreenivasan Bestest phone in this range of price my mom love to use this one con of this phone is its too 😶bulky I thought it can be used as 😎DUMBLE😎 for exercise 😀😀😀1️⃣Fingerprint sensor 8102️⃣Battery life 95103️⃣Camera with this price brand 910 Some smasung apps can’t delete samsung forcing me to use it it’s really disappointed me In other hand apple allows you to delete any app even phonebook and you can use third party phonebook Display Battery Size look processor all Good Camera needs to be betterOnly phone and charger you will get No headphone The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The phone hangs a lot everyday for atleast 2 times Then it automatically switches off and restarts Touch response is really bad on this one Doesnt even give the feedback of having 6gb ram Seems less than 2gb Please dont buy any Samsung it is good upto one year only then next month  you have to spend money at Samsung service center frequently for example yesterday my m31s display gone while watching movie which is purchased on September 2020 Very heavy product Plz check actual weight before buying Samsung states it to be of 221 gram but it was 265 grams when we physically checked We didnt evaluated phone for other features as weight of phone was itself biggest negative feature Fingerprint reader is too good it working smoothly Battery life is also good once in a day I charge my mobile at 80 it sufficient for whole day Just I want some more features in camera for taking pictures by rare camera Overall performance is too good for gaming The Phone will hang too much Dont waste your money in this Choose another Because once you buy You cannot return the phone at any cost nor you will get refund In this case you will stuck with the phone They will send replacement but every model will work slow Phone was very good its awesome and its an nice phone for this price and phone features are very good I got it for my mother to attend zoom calls Its been 3days and she has not been able to attend the call with audio All combinationssettings has been tried Feel bad that I cant help sitting from far Can the service center help in Kanpur Great deal This is the best in the category Fingerprint camera and battery is much better than any Chinese mobile Best Product in this range and not for heavy  drivers  Much  better  for daily use  and medium productivity purposeRear  Camera shoots  steady videos and detailed pictures Prosear slow display good battery backup good price High hai 7000

fully happy This phone   seal broken   54 charged   Lots of fingerprints already applied   Lots more Looks like Amazon is turning into flipkart Cameraslow motion missing nice processor goodFor app lock you should download applicationNot having enough inbuilt like Mi if you use Mi you will be little disappointed bz at ds price Mi give more system and user friendly phone Poor internet catching Lagging and hanging Dont buy Poor assistance and support for warranty Totally disappointed with this phone Really disappointed after receiving the mobile Over weight and there is wifi calling option no headphones no screen cover and case cover Bettry to go with redmi mobile Good mobile at this price Finger print slitly working littil bit slowAnd bettery life is goodCamera quality so good48 mp is good And products are in good condition I booked 2 phone and i received 2 with good packing M12 is the worst mobile of Samsung and if you went for its service center with any minor scratches or problem they will say  It can not be considered under warranty policyIn one word they are doing a cheap minded business They do not provide any warranty Product is overall good I used 6 GB RAM based phone earlier with 7000 mah motoG 5G model and this device M12 Samsung is lot much better in battery management compared to i5 and Camera quality is below average  Whatever you click image got distorted Disappointed with camera Not good as I expect during charging getting heated and touch not work properly  getting hang also today I asked coustomer care to replace they deny as it 7 days replacement now its 8 days I am not satisfied with phone  Overall rating is four because my phone has sound concern At max volume volume is not really high Its fairly low volume and on video calls

clarity not good expected much better with the mp it claims Not lived upto expectation This Mobile is awesome  The finger print sensor is working good Itll suits best for buying a mobile to mother or dadPerfect battery performance Good back camIts only for normal use and common using purposesYou cannot expect it for gaming The display quality is really disappointing along with the camera The built quality is average and it really looks like the the average budget phone Not very excited with this performance on day 1 and feel helplss as there is no return policy as well I like this product for its battery life finger print reader and camera quality I wanted return this item but this not possiblewhy couldnt not understand Earlier i used to return the item  Worst experience i faced with amezon Its hanging too muchAudio is not clear in video call and mobile is heat up instantlyit is a worst mobile I used many Samsung but it is worst phone The phone with massive 6000 mah battery give you ultimate nonstop 8 hour of gaming and loses only 100 to10 but problem is 15w charger which charges the phone in 2 hours 45 minutes and heating issues but all is OK overall good choice Received a defective product Looks like refurbished product sent Having audio issues Faulty speakers Receiver could not hear my voice clearly Very disappointed with Amazon sending faulty product Disappointed with the performanceCamera pictures are not as good as 48 mega pixel Camera  4 front camera has no useBattery is goodProcessor is slowRefresh rate is true is words onlyLight weight I ordered this phone 3 months before for my son Till today me and my son is very happy and satisfied with this phone Purchase was worthy and I vll recommend if budget lies 1000015000 then go for this phone Battery life is normal and camera quality is very poor Also screen touch is not that much good So I highly recommend not to buy this product The mobile hanged within a week after buying I am not satisfied with it and hope my review will helpful for you too The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Thank you  samsung  This is my first mobile  it is soon good to all the fetcher  in my opening camera is need much better  other wise this mobile  is very very good Thanks  samsung Dont buy this phone Many manufacturing problems Mainly network issue Internet wont connect

optionScreenshot using palm swipe is missingBattery backup is fabulous 1 and 12 half on a single charge Dolby atmos sometime doesnt workSamsung claims 48mp true cam but its output is similar to 8mp The phone design and performance are pretty impressive Despite being 48 mp the camera disappoints and fails to clearly capture a little far off things I expected more but overall its a budget phone The weight of the phone is a bulky one but can get use to it This is best option for under 15k budget It ticks all the boxes like storage memory and display Good built quality from samsung Phone is Hanging very much even the software is up to dates and also the apps front camera is average phone is working like 2 gb ram after using half an hour and have to clear memory very timenot satisfied with samsung brand The overall experience was really bad as the phone is lagging many times and battery is not upto the mark Do not buy this if you are looking for a good camera Really disappointed

monster reloaded but refresh time is slow and when you open multiple app phone get slower for a while Battery is good but backup may be improved Over all its a monster again from my all time favorite brand Samsung Phone is upto the mark as expected ProsBattery camera finger print sensor design and build quality are highly commendableConsThe image editing features is too slow to open takes at least 3 secondsSound quality is of average phone Battery life is awesome  Fingerprint sensor is mindblowing  Processor is little bit slow  Camera quality is average Charger cord is very short  Fast Charger

product was safe Also the product works well Like due to quality of camera and battery backup is so good But some problem is continue in Samsung phone like fast charging problem and same slow running feature A phone is an indispensable companion and tool nowadays and I use my phone for all activities of modern life The phone is topped up with all the latest features Camera resolution is not good specially in zoomHeavyBattery is good This was the phone I bought at the last great Indian festival The internet has not been available since I started using it Taken to service center several times

can play pubg no heating issues  It uses only 10 of battery in 1 hour of pubg gaming but doesnt contains applock for the device its a draw back  Totally its worth for money Nice looking nice working For normal user its quit good but who wants to use it for gaming purpose then its not a better choice because not up to the mark in this pointGetting slow sometime but if i speak about its bettery life then yes performing well Battery is ultra super charging speed is also good however the quality of camera is third class super bakwass quality is even less than of 5 mega pixel camera  this is

the product There is no Samsung quality ExcellentI do here recommend to go for this product through Amazon which provides very good service Overall mobile is good but for gaming this mobile does not have the gyroscope feature that is very besic thingI really disappointed 😞 by this Thanks Amazon I get this bank offer and coupons 10k mobile working fine and smooth What is use of good battery life if Screen display too pure along with camera quality decided and PLEASE don’t Samsung phone and with same price  we can get good phone on other models and came to know they samsung is a brand with No quality  To much difficult set settings Not user friendly Camera clarity not expected as per given spec Proximity senser not worked when u try to set on speaker phone at same time Screen will off Overall its ordinary phone Very cheap quality product I didnt expect it at this price 😤 Writing this review after 2 days of usagePros  Better resolution Nice build quality Super back design which is sturdy and does not slip from our hand Faster UI performanceCons  Front camera is blurry sometimes Not happy with this product as its really irritating me to install so many apps like music player applock and all Since biometric lock is already there it should ideally allow us to use the same for securing our apps as well Probably the best deal in this price could not find better deal even on local market This mobile is good for parents and old people The processor of this is good for day to day tasks so dont expect gaming A decent overall package if someone wants to buy a Samsung device Phone hangs very poor camera quality sometimes call does not get connect I got the phone in 2 days after ordering it and it was awesome The game changer at this price It has everything new the ui which is one ui 31 and battery is damn goodi wuse it for nearly 2 hours and the battery percentage dropped by 10 only 😯 Good battery life fast charging option to disableuninstall preinstalled apps Phone is a bit thick and heavy to hold it can be tiring if hold for very long period of time90Hz display is nice but only adaptive option available in settings Its been 4 months and the Phone is running like a monster Finger print reader is good Battery life is amazing and excellent Upto 36 hours the battery run with constant wifi on and using Zoomgoogle meet and many more battery draining apps Rear camera quality is good Not to recommend from mobile device efficiency and price point of view Hai if are in the league of band made in Chinese good then opt in Ps Most of the material are from main land only if not made in Chinna tag I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I want to say just one thing it is SUPERRRRRRRRRB phone Its camera quality Is best and processor is super fast Average Camera Quality Not 48MP quality Front Camera very normalRoughly 2 days backup without videoGPS ON but on calling and full time internet on Its a decent phone for the price it comes Built quality is good and display of 720 means the 6000 mah battery will long last Good gadget if using as secondary phone Gaming experience is average Overall a good budget phone I bought this phone for my father He is very light user of the phone But still I would say the most surprising part was the battery life it is amazing The phone lasts for four days on a complete charge Got the phone only a couple  of days  back Package was delivered in good condition Camera is just okay Battery life is good uses 30 if one is playing songs on YouTube for 68hrs But there is no headphone in the box Hence 4 stars It has only 24Ghz wifi but processor is capable of 5GHZ wifi  very powerful  battery  life it have some ads in Samsung interfaces its have good  90hz display  camera  quality  not good its below  average Battery life is worst Overall product is not good Dont Samsung product The product is just awesome It almost satisfied it expectations Loved it The phone have lots of issue like auto restart and error msg showing Not register Network and auto shut down hang issue Pls return this product Really nice and easy to use phone with 90hz refresh rate and 48mp camera and 8nm processor thanks Samsung for such a nice phone for only 13500 Heavy phone Camera not so good Blue color doesnt look good Take black or White I took blue and now I cant exchange as there is no option Poor camera resultIts not loke 48Mp its like 2MpPlese avoid to place order of this diviceAnd not blue colour like seen in image show by amzonePoor result and worst of full moneyDont buy this samsung m12 by amzone There is no hands free with this device So if you want to listen to music or see a movie purchase your own separately Or listen on its speakers  I purchased this phone for my mom For her usage this phone is enough This smart phone consists of many problems like slow working of operating system and touch screen is worst compared to other mobiles and getting some unusual sounds from mobile need some proper response from Amazon team to take the mobile back ASAP Camera photo quality poorMobile Hang problem too muchTotally wastage of moneyFingerprint sensor also slowTotally wastage of hard earning money The phone is not working properly Not able to hear anything when not in speaker It arrived late and now the return window is closed in just 5 days Not so comfortable in hand for daily use  or gaming  very heavy and large although afterall of samsung so no worry only weight is an issue Mobile start working too slow within 2 days and also giving network issue but in that price best product from other always Giving feeling off brand  Battery  life is great  Camera is also good  Performance is  excellent Nice sleek and  beautiful  look White color  mobile  looks  extremely beautiful  Overall  a monster  in true  sense Worth  buying Thanks  Amazon  and Samsung LikesGood Battery lifeFinger print reader is OKDislikesSlow response rateCamera clarity is below parScreen refresh rate is avgQuite Heavy Nice product still lacks functions which come in other phones at this range Ordered this product as a gift for my aunt It took about a week for her to set it up after adding a sim we found the display and touch are unresponsive Would love it if someone would get in touch and offer a replacement for this defective unit A high quality product with high class camera finger print sensor and camera  Facial recognition is also quite good  Great touch pad Very nice budget phone battery is very nice fingerprint is also smooth  I like fast processor lots of lovethanks Samsung As expected the battery life and fingerprint reader The camera quality is good Hi guys Just two weeks back brought this phone There is a software or hardware problem What’s up is not working and even some application some times it automatically gets restart Better avoid …Uploaded a pic for information Such a bulky phone do not buy it I bought it in blue color and it made me remember nokia 3315 bulky phone I asked amazon apni dukan to return they also denied Now thinking what to do Overall features likeits outfit is very fashionableI really loved blue colour Battery life is extremely good Picture qualities are very good definitely because of camera quality Not as expected the voice While calling is not good no finger print Not satisfied Touch screen is not working properly When I open some app its opening some thing else  Please avoid this phone Perfect combination of features for a Android Phone Fingerprint reader works perfectly Battery 6000maH is another selling point Battery life  excellent display is good for the price 90hz refresh rate will not make you wow speed is just normal side mount fingerprint is ok not much fast Not a high end producttoo long time it takes to load directories Value for money storage and battery life is very impressive FHD display is very useful to attend video calls No lag or hanging issue Altogether very good device at this cost Quite bulky and a heavy phone probably due to battery size Touch screen is quite sluggish and unresponsive on some occasions Camera quality is way too average Didnt expect this kind of product from Samsung Already planning to sell this phone 12 month baad pata chalega kyoki wedhar ke karan bhi mobile me gadbad hoti hai baaris thandi me heng hota hai aur garmiyo me batry loss hoti hai Unlike and mobile was shutdown please any one dont purchase Samsung mobile  hanging issue and customer care care less answers and mobile waste Mobile is little heavy Everything  else good if you are a normal  user The mobile with 6 GM RAM and 128 GB storage including high resolution front and rear camera are good But it  weighs more than 200 gms and that is a big concern Posting my review after 2 months usage Exynoss Processor is the biggest draw back It hangs and there is lag application launch  I would not recommend this phone for this price range Very Good phone  at most economical price with 6 GB ram 128 GB Memory and 6000 mah  battery 🔋 Not preferable mobile Games closing on its own Heavy size not a handy size Writing this after 4 months of use overall the phone is damn good considering the priceProsGood battery backupAmazing displayTerrific UIUXConsCamera quality when its darkBulky Satisfied with the features till dateNo complaints so farBattery performance  is much better than othersAnd its actually a better performance  phoneAnd not that costlyIt fulfil my purrpose of multitasking  Good Battery Life Good for people who don’t want a very high performing phone for playing games and other stuff that requires high graphics Overall 35 ratings for general purpose use like whatsapp FB Mails and Calls Best thing is the long battery charge that avoids frequent charging Dont purchase this phone process is low as compare to others As i have used from last 30 days automatic app closed not open try multiple time youtube also auto forwardTaking too much time to load an appDont waste your money Samsung M12 it is very nice The Camera U Mentioned 48 Mp real but compare to other model of Samsung the 48 Mp real is not as much as good the working and battery back up everything is good but we want camera little bit improved  Slow phone with sub par camera just 48mp on paper Also everytime the OS installs some junk apps while updating the phone Samsung kindly do not distribute bloatware in the name of updatesystem update camera display quality not satisfy  and nor return option available very bad experience Some time the beep voice for notifications not stopit is continuously berpingafter switch off it stopit is a big problemno one is attending call on Samsung cust6care plz solve this problemi have left time to change this mobile Wrost phone dont ever buy it because after buying u cant return or replace to amazon The phone gets hang  dam slow and is the worst ever phone i have seen Amazon doesnt takes back bad products which they sell thats why they dont have any return policy in it Camera Quality splendidFingerprint quality splendidBattery quality splendidPrograms splendidBest Budget Smartphone All over good mobile quality is good as compared to priceCamera performance does not look like 48 megapixelsRest things are goodBudget friendly mobile in Samsung The battery life is good but the phone is havi it is not thin or lite weightNormal camara and 48 mp camara is good but the wide angle and macro camara are not good the portrait camara is average There is no night mod in the camara Its a nice product in this price good configuration Overall performance is also good Only concern is its getting heated on continuous use I’m just a regular user of this phone and don’t find any such issues with the performance I think the only complains that I have are with the weight of the phone and with the latest updates the speaker quality went down After a new software update i got many issues like hang problem heating problem Dont trust on Samsung product कैमरा क्वालिटी बिल्कुल खराब है बैटरी भी अच्छे से चार्ज नहीं होती फोन भी काफी वजन है और मोटा है अच्छा नहीं लगता प्रोसेसर काफी लो है और जिस तरीके से कैमरा और बैटरी बताया गया है उस तरीके से यह चल भी नहीं रहा है मुझे लगता है कि शायद सक्सेस नहीं है Battery life  its the bestPicture quality  is very goodValue for money  excellent There is no injection pin for mobile and no user guidewe have measured 13499 for this handset and I guess that is it a sample handset answer me AmazonI will write review if handset works fine within return periodhope so M12 is really given me more satisfaction and return of price which I have paid The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Hanging issue battery draing issue apps crashing apps issues in the very first day  phone got delivered i bought 2 Samsung m12 both have same issue Samsung customer care said buy from samsung official site Battery life and camera is good some person complain about phone performance I dont know what they expect from cellphone

badFinally dont waste your and dont choose Samsung productthis product can not be exchange any SellerPlease dont  by this product Bought for 10299 in Great india sale now being sold on same Amazon for 9500 or lower Feel cheated to have bought in Great India Sale assuming lower cost benefit  Samsung delivers as promised the Samsung M12 is definitely Monster Reloaded You get all the premium features for such a affordable price I would recommend 1010 I like the fingerprint reader the way its on power button n obviously the battery life is very good Good but not upto mark The phone is too heavy and its front camera is not suitable at this priceBack camera is finebattery life is excellentand other features are also fineSound quality is loud and clear Overall nice phone Need to upgrade processor for same price some other brands give better performance then this phone in same price rangeThis phone lags too much in small thingsSamsung need to give some effort on mid range smartphone The battery life for this mobile is excellent The mobile is little heavier as compared to previously used mobiles of mine The camera quality is very average The mobile does its work and the refresh rate makes the browsing experience good Phones software and other apps were not updated and phone not working like 6 GB RAM overall unsatisfactory phone Not happy at all with samsungwithin 4 month hang problem start with my phonen to many times my sim out of reachedevery  2or  3 days I use flight mode option to restore my call service The Phone is an excellent Product However I had to face a lot of problems in setting the phone I would advise you to include the  setting up of phone even if you charge a extra few hundred rupees The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I dont like the product and also Amazon service the dont return tha orderso pls dont buy itand the phone has some latest features missing like screen shot and screen recorder and internet speedetc This Samsung Mobile Successful and very good performance And its work system also very good and my use more working with business  For game not to buy Small game run good And its running performance first class I suggest that this buy Please note that the phone is heavy as hell credits to its 6000mah Else everything is good considering its value yeah dont expect much from the display The phone is very slowNot a 6 gb ram model as advertised The speed in reality is slower than a 3 gb ram versionI wouldnt advice buying this phone In three months time the mobile speaker has stopped working Despite best efforts not able to raise a complaint through customer servive Its a good mobile with a great battery life and a moderate camera quality But the only thing is it should have had the fingerprint reader on the rear side of the mobile But its cool overall The best mobile with relatively less price with very good features Display is poor all other features are ok above voice mail notification cannot be removed and it annoying Only battery life is good and all remaining qualities are wrost Also hanging problemDont buy this phone M12so never buy this phone Camera is only 48mega pixel only in document in real it is euqal to like 8 megapixel camera Its good for a aveage man  Camera quality is good Also it has huge battery so one have not to bother to charge it again and again It was a good buy in this range In last the main thing is i got this phone 1k less from market price 😁 Camera is Ok  battery life is fine  fingerprint working okoverall phone is ok in less amount Very late chargingCamera

You can shift between apps with ease Battery life is excellent Touch and feel excellent Actually still is more remains to be explored  but till now experience is excellent A fairly descent device  But  slightly on a heavier side  Finger print reader not that good for security as it is less spaced and not good sensing tech in this phone arearest camera is fine and good according to specifications battery is good too Front camera refresh rate is lowBloatwares and lock screen advertisement Ok phone and the camera is so so need to update phone in this amount range as other companies are providing good hardware in this range Super mobile Getting too hang and heat touch not working properly when I try to type something when I asked replaced or return from Amazon within two days when I got new

Finger print is fast Screen is also good happy with product You never completing about battery Its battery life is too good and its fingerprint reader is fabulous camera qualities is also good but camera quality is not 5 star type it is 4 star So Overall it is the best  smart phoneSAMSUNG is the best Only battery back up is nice Camera quality is not good Finger print reader is fine not up to mark  I suggest dont go on videos of you tube regarding the videos of this modelI would never buy mobile phone specially from any online stores Value for money Good qualityOnly problem is handset weight is slightly more may be due to 6000 mah batteryTotally satisfied Recommended you to buy If you Tr y to return it within 10 days you will not be given any option You will always find No options

phone battery is really awesome  nice built quality nice camera good display in this price for 6 128 Good but heavy samsung has unmatched operating system interface but battery is too heavy I guess

normally use this for messages and mail It gives problems with automatic brightness control It stays on low brightness unless I open notification drop down then it goes back to normal W w it is good but the processing speed of this phone is slow and downloading speed also in his own while the data speed is above 100 mbps using this for some time I feel the fingerprint doesnt work and phone get hang Camara and video quality is not so goodExperiencing slowness while using phonePhone is getting hanged I sincerely suggest not to buy samsung mid range phones Im facing worst experience  with this

नोटिफिकेशन आने पर बजती है।इसको चार्ज़िंग पर लगाने और फोन के चार्ज होने का कोई भी संकेत नहीं मिलता है।नोटिफिकेशन से सम्बंधित प्रकाश संकेत इसमे उपलब्ध नहीं है जिससे स्क्रीन लॉक होने पर नोटिफिकेशन की जानकारी नहीं हो पाती है।भार में भी ये अन्य फोनो से काफी ज्यादा है।कैमरा तो चार चार है पर पिक्चर की गुणवत्ता संतोषजनक नहीं है।वाई फाई की रेंज बहुत ही कम है एक दीवार के बाद डाउनलोड की स्पीड अत्यंत कम हो जाती। mere life ka sabs khrab anubhavmai aap sab se kahunga samsung m12 mobil ko kabhi mat lena galti se bhi mat lenadisplay bahut bahut kharabspe bahut bahut kharabcamera bahut bahut kharabbatteri
